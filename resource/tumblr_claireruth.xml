    <title>soixante-trois: le careme.</title>
    <description></description>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>This year I have decided to fully embrace my Catholicism for Lent and give up meat. </p>
<p>For forty days and forty nights</p>
<p>Just like Jesus in the desert.</p>
<p>(With the devil)</p>

<p>Except that I&#8217;m not a massive fan of meat anyway. And I&#8217;m still going to eat fish. So basically I have become the easiest -tarian that one could possibly be, YET this is still inexplicably creating unforeseen issues for people. </p>
<p>Despite the fact that I&#8217;m essentially pescetarian at university anyway. IT IS THE EASIEST OF ALL OF THE -ARIANISMS<br/><br/>And let us remember that I am not becoming vegan. It is not that difficult. Really, I should be making more of an effort. <br/><br/>My first pescey issue (oh yes, I love puns, I do study English after all) occurred just over a week ago, as I was buying my lunch in Coventry train station. I believe I have previously described the aforementioned place in a rather unfavourable light, so I won&#8217;t bore you with more details. Needless to say, the only shop present at this station is a WH Smiths, with a pretty poor selection of products which is fair enough really, seeing as once I was inside with my bags there wasn&#8217;t any room for anyone else. It is tiny. </p>
<p>So I should not have been surprised that the only two non-meaty meals on offer were cheese, cheese, and more cheese. With pickle. I do not like pickle. And I do not like soggy cheese. Which were the only options available to me.</p>

<p>Luckily it wasn&#8217;t Lent yet so I had chicken.</p>
<p>Oops.</p>
<p>The next pescey issue is the somewhat mocking support I have received. My boyfriend&#8217;s main concern was, &#8220;Will it affect me?". My reply: &#8220;No of course not, I&#8217;m not giving up meat for any ethical reasons, you can eat it and I&#8217;ll even cook it for you" (I know, lucky right?). Alas, his dad is the one doing the cooking, and last weekend he presented us with the choices of vegetable or prawn curry. Neither of which my boyfriend likes. Definitely not my fault. </p>
<p>To further prove that the above episode was entirely not my fault, on Valentine&#8217;s Day we made pizzata together (YES THIS IS A REAL THING) and I allowed him to put pepperoni on his slice after we had served it.  It didn&#8217;t touch my meal, so all is well. </p>
<p>My mum has also been in a tizz as to what to cook for me. I am not eating meat. I am eating everything else. Indeed, I am even eating seafood. I am essentially cheating. I am a bad person. <br/>Mind you, I couldn&#8217;t think of any ideas as to what she could cook for me when she asked. Oops. Also not my fault&#8230; maybe. </p>
<p>My boyfriend also likes to call me pesky&#8230; pescey&#8230; Everyone loves this pun. I even love this pun, although it is at my expense.</p>
<p>I have come to appreciate the trials and tribulations full on, committed vegetarians have to face every single day. I don&#8217;t think I will miss meat, but I do think that I will miss the lack of judgement that I for some strange reason must now put up with, and the vast array of options that I seem to be purposefully avoiding as I skim past the meat section in shops, restaurants and supermarkets, thus making my lack of choice ALL MY FAULT. Well done vegetarians, you are certainly better than me, and you&#8217;re probably better than everyone else too. WH Smith has taught me this. </p>
<p>I may just not eat meat ever again. Take that, cruel, meat-eating world. But save the prawns for me&#8230;</p>]]></content>

    <title>soixante-deux: la pensee apres coup.</title>
    <description></description>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>It has been hard starting afresh after Bordeaux<em>. </em>I always expected the return to university to be difficult, especially seeing as I&#8217;m now in final year and the volume of work is tremendous, coupled with the necessity to think about the uncertain future of life afterwards. I am not, however, looking back upon my year abroad with nostalgia. Certainly, I did enjoy it, but I&#8217;m not particularly eager to rush back across the channel. </p>
<p><span>I have always been a real home-bird, unenthusiastic to leave the nest to find my own way <em>sans parents</em>.  University has changed that - or so I thought. It would appear that the only way I was going to take flight on my own was by being forced into completing a year abroad in France. Ultimately, this said obligatory experience made me realise why it remains so necessary. Would I have ever willingly chosen to throw myself wholeheartedly into another country, knowing how many difficulties I would face? Probably not; indeed, admittedly beforehand I barely gave this portion of my degree a second thought. All I needed was a not-so-little push to take off, encounter obstacles and delights in what would become one of my favourite places in the world, and eventually ready myself for the return to Warwick.</span></p>
<p><span>But have I been readied for the return? I don&#8217;t feel as though I have. Granted, the year abroad was a pleasant interlude and gave a significant boost to my confidence and to my language skills. But the very notion of essay writing makes me feel as nauseous as those creepy French men once did. It&#8217;s notably quite difficult to acclimatise once more to university life, so I have to keep trying.</span></p>
<p><span>I will always sort of look back fondly upon my year abroad, and encourage others to undertake a similar endeavour if they get the opportunity, but ultimately I don&#8217;t think I could do it again. </span></p>
<p><span>Especially as I sort of promised my boyfriend that I never would, and even more especially because I promised myself that I never would either. </span></p>]]></content>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>I have been back at university for nearly three weeks and it&#8217;s almost as if the summer  and the year abroad didn&#8217;t even exist. A memory that I can sort of fathom but not really define as a concrete entity. </p>
<p>The pile of work has started to increase, and so I am officially back. For final year.</p>
<p>Which means that the job search and the quest to define the rest of my life has well and truly commenced.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m firing off CVs and starting the process of application for a MA in Translation. Career research is continuously on my to do list, along with reading Shakespeare, preparing my French oral presentation and the study of early modern French thought. </p>
<p>Keeping my head above water. That is the short-term aim. The long-term aim is much more difficult to obtain. </p>]]></content>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>This time next week I&#8217;ll be sat in Gatwick airport waiting (im)patiently for my plane to Manchester.</p>
<p>Enfin.</p>
<p>Bordeaux, as much as I love you, it&#8217;s time for me to leave now. I&#8217;m ready to go home.  Unless all my friends, my family and Martin suddenly decide that they would like to move here instead, but knowing the likelihood of this scenario, I think it would be for the best if I just left.</p>
<p>Sorry. We&#8217;ll stay friends and stay in touch. </p>
<p>Now I&#8217;ve finished teaching, finished my final essay of this year and all my friends here have up and left (wisely I now realise), I am not really doing anything productive. And I could be equally unproductive at home. Who knows, I might even find some work experience or a job as well&#8230; </p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t even mind just spending the summer trying to distract myself from the ever looming presence of final year. New York is on the cards.</p>
<p>Yes, my year abroad has been so much better than I could have ever possibly imagined, but I would like it finish now please. If that&#8217;s okay. </p>]]></content>

    <title>cinquante-neuf: presque fini?</title>
    <description></description>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>So I am still completely clueless as to whether I&#8217;m supposed to be teaching tomorrow.  Personally, I think I&#8217;m slightly inclined as to not wanting to teach. I&#8217;ve got quite used to getting up whenever I please (and then feeling a little bit guilty about it) and working away without a really big scary deadline looming in front of me. But we&#8217;ll see. Even if I do have to go to school, this really will be my last day.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t surprise me that I have no real feelings about this. Throughout this assistantship I have felt almost indifferent towards teaching, a sentiment which I didn&#8217;t expect prior to my year abroad. I thought I might love it, and that would be future career sorted. I would take hatred over indifference, at least I would be able to rule out one possibility for the future. Instead I still have no idea what I want. </p>
<p>I have finally finished <em>Education sentimentale </em>by Flaubert. Not a lot really happens to be honest, but the language was impressive all the same. After having read this incredibly long lesser-known-than-good-old-<em>Madame-Bovary</em> <em>oeuvre</em>, I have turned my attentions to <em>Justine</em> by Marquis de Sade. I have no idea why, I honestly cannot justify this except for the fact that it was a free e-book and I was trying to fill my Kindle with French literature. I maybe should have done some research first. </p>
<p>The thing is, I don&#8217;t usually have any aversions when it comes to literature. I am fairly good at distancing myself from books, it&#8217;s films where I have more trouble because I can&#8217;t control the image in front of me with the latter format. I am the person who read <em>American Psycho</em> unflinchingly on the bus to college and just before my English Language A Level exam (something which required very little revision, evidently). I will never watch the film, although I am told that the book is actually more explicit, something which shouldn&#8217;t really surprise me when I recall some of the plot details. I am also the person who cites Chuck Palahnuik among her favourite authors. I&#8217;ve read all of his books and the only time I came close to feeling the nausea I have been experiencing whilst reading <em>Justine</em> is maybe during the short story <em>Guts</em> (in the <em>Haunted</em> collection of short stories), and to be fair at least I didn&#8217;t faint like many people did when Palahnuik took his stories on the road and read them aloud to the delight (and horror, admittedly) of many. </p>
<p>So why is the book so gut-wrenching? I am approximately 20% of the way through (as my Kindle informs me, one useful property which still doesn&#8217;t entirely convince me that this device is in any way superior to books in lovely printed format) and part of me is tempted to give up. I have only ever truly given up on reading two books in my whole life (I eventually returned to <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> though it took some courage&#8230;). The first was <em>It</em>, just because I was genuinely petrified. I&#8217;ve never liked clowns. The second was <em>Angels and Demons</em>, and I think there is no need to justify myself here, it&#8217;s fairly obvious why everyone should give up on this book. I don&#8217;t want to give up on <em>Justine</em>, partly because of my pride (also known as stubbornness) and partly because of the fact that I&#8217;m reading French which can&#8217;t do me any harm, linguistically that is. I think the worst part of this book is the fact that now a routine has been established, and that I know that whenever the <em>pauvre</em> Justine encounters a man (or several, for that matter) I should anticipate what will follow, and this feeling of dread in picturing what will happen to her next (because everything can and will happen) is actually worse than the graphic details. You would think that the same would go for <em>American Psycho</em>, but actually the &#8216;reality&#8217; always exceeded the gory horrors conjured by my imagination. </p>
<p>I think I need to go back to reading Murakami or something that will cheer my soul and not make me feel physically sick&#8230;</p>]]></content>

    <description></description>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>So I&#8217;m in the process of writing my final year abroad essay for my university. How it works at Warwick is that you have three essays to write over the course of your stay in France, and it&#8217;s best to pick three different topics so you have a broad (ha!) knowledge of French culture in general so that you can tackle final year French classes like a boss. Theoretically.</p>
<p>I have just sent off my second of these essays which was about the popularity of Marine Le Pen, although I stressed throughout that she probably won&#8217;t become President just in case whoever the poor soul is that has to mark my work doesn&#8217;t think I&#8217;m completely insane. However, though I have just in fact waved <em>au revoir</em> to this particular essay I must now commence the final one in order to send it before the deadline near the end of May.</p>
<p>For those of you who don&#8217;t know me (which I think includes pretty much everyone in the entire world) I do rather enjoy worrying for no reason.</p>
<p>The hardest part of writing these essays apart from, well, writing these essays, is <em>en fait</em> choosing a topic. Which brings me to the point of this post. As I am considering writing about the French language in some way or another, I did some research and discovered that 91% of French people think that their language is the most important element of the French national identity. I&#8217;m not quite sure yet how exactly I&#8217;m going to use this statistic, but it did make me wonder: how important do other nationalities consider their language in the construction of their national identity? </p>
<p>Or is this just a really, really stupid question?</p>]]></content>

    <title>cinquante-sept: presque fini.</title>
    <description></description>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>I think last Friday was my last day at school. This uncertainty pretty much optimises my experience as a language assistant.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I have quite enjoyed teaching English. My lessons on Friday reminded me of how much fun teaching can potentially be, even if I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s the career path I am destined to take. Moments where I ask my students for the time and they respond by singing High School Musical or where I tell off some students in the corridor in French and return to a round of applause from my actual class. How can moments like this fail to make you warm to the idea of teaching?</p>
<p>It feels quite strange to think that in just over three weeks, I&#8217;ll be going home for good. No more Bordeaux. No more walking across the Pont de Pierre everyday to get to school with my massive <em>cartable </em>and laptop in tow. No more 12 euro <em>formules</em> allowing us to eat out cheaply on a regular basis. No more feelings of uncertainty when I go to school. No more creeps on the tram, in the street, everywhere. No more speaking French on a daily basis and forgetting what you wanted to say mid-sentence. No more homesickness. No more travel problems. No more wages. </p>
<p>I will be finished, and I will be happy. But a part of me will be sad. I have enjoyed this year so much more than I ever dreamed I would. Especially when I think back to 24th September in John Lennon Liverpool Airport, when I watched my parents and Martin disappear before me as I climbed more and more escalators towards the departure lounge. Back then I thought I would never come home. </p>
<p>But I am going home. And I&#8217;ll just find something else to complain about when that time comes. <em>Comme toujours.</em> </p>]]></content>

    <title>cinquante-six: les raclures (francais?).</title>
    <description></description>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>So my initial intention here was to rant about the abundance of creepy French men I have noticed during my stay in Bordeaux, but I would rather prefer to avoid any sweeping generalisations of the sexist and racist variety.</p>
<p>BUT</p>
<p>I had a rather unfortunate incident last Sunday which made me finally lose any patience I had remaining with the creepy male population of France. </p>
<p>Please note my repetition of the word &#8216;creepy&#8217;. Because it is the &#8216;creepy&#8217; men in particular I would like to rage against. There are undoubtedly creepy men the world over, but it would seem that it is particularly difficult in France to avoid these such characters.</p>
<p>Especially when the sun comes out.</p>
<p>I do not go out of my way to wear very little clothing, which I feel is both necessary and unnecessary to point out. Necessary because I&#8217;d like to preserve a little dignity here, and also unnecessary because really, it&#8217;s nobody&#8217;s business and I&#8217;d like to think that in fact I don&#8217;t really care what anybody thinks. Unfortunately the latter is near-impossible, so I am forced to emphasise that actually, my skirts and dresses are not all that short and if I thought that they were for a second I wouldn&#8217;t wear them.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, what a girl wears (or doesn&#8217;t for that matter) should not be signalled as an open invitation. <em>Malheureusement</em> it often is. Needless to say that when the weather starts to improve dresses and skirts and shorts begin to make an appearance, and the men just get creepier.</p>
<p>It makes me appreciate my man all the more, really.</p>
<p>To return to the purpose of this rant, the fuel which fuelled my anger so to speak, last Sunday I was enjoying a rather lovely pre-summer&#8217;s day in Bordeaux as I walked to my tutoring lesson. Although pre-summer in Bordeaux is practically summer. I passed KFC, a delightful restaurant around the corner from where I live. Two men were sat outside, enjoying fried chicken in the sunshine. One of them felt the need to attempt to grab my arm as I walked past; something was said to me but I was too shaken and downright furious to understand the creepy words (in French, of course) coming from this ridiculous human being. So I decided to shout at him. In French.</p>
<p><em>"Qu&#8217;est-ce que vous faites?</em> (I think the <em>&#8216;vous&#8217;</em> was rather polite on my part to be honest)&#8230; followed by <em>"DEGOUTANT"</em> in a very loud, infuriated French voice which exploded from little old me as I power walked angrily away from KFC.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure what the man in question&#8217;s response was but I hope sincerely that he was genuinely terrified.</p>
<p>From now on I resolve to do more than just shoot disgusted looks at these creepy men who think they have the right to comment as they pass me by. On that same walk on Sunday I passed several other creepy men who felt the need to make some sort of creepy comment towards me. I&#8217;m not going to stand for this any more, whether I am in France or <em>chez moi</em>. I must reiterate that it isn&#8217;t just a male French thing to do these creepy things, but these occurrences have taken place a lot more here than they have at home. I&#8217;m not saying that I&#8217;m going to let these creeps provoke me, because I am almost certain that this is the aim of their comments apart from obviously trying to entice me (who are they kidding???), but I am certainly going to make it perfectly clear to them that what they are doing is not normal and it is not acceptable. My year in France has made me a more confident person and I&#8217;m not going to let these creepy men get away with ridiculous things like this. </p>

<p>In other news, I&#8217;ve been to Paris and Archacon in the past two weeks and had a fabulous time. I do have a tendancy to focus on the slightly more negative issues at hand. Hence, I will soon publish some pictures of the aforementioned visits to lighten the mood of this rather indignant post. </p>]]></content>

    <title>cinquante-cinq: l'art d'etre une fausse Francaise.</title>
    <description></description>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Seeing as in my last (written) post I discussed the pitfalls of clearly being English whilst living in France, I thought that now I should turn my attention to what one should do if one truly wishes to fake it as a <em>vrai(e) Français(e)</em> (please note how I have included both genders, <em>très gentil</em> yes). Equally please note that I&#8217;m not sure how successful the following methods are, as I meet with varied levels of success on a day-to-day basis. The thing that terrifies me is that I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ll ever be fluent in French, because how can you quantify communication or the use of a language? But I&#8217;ll try not to let that worry me too much. For now, I shall continue to do the following:</p>

<p>1. Change Facebook to French.</p>
<p>2. Same goes for Skype.</p>
<p>3. Purchase a French cookbook, struggle laboriously to understand the list of ingredients and then equally to find them in the ridiculously huge supermarket, thus forcing you to give up and just make a stir fry instead, because it sort of looks like the picture of the meal anyway. Sort of.</p>
<p>4. Pass a French person on the street/in the school corridor/where you live/anywhere in particular and in engage in the French equivalent of what is known in the North as &#8216;Y&#8217;alreyt? Y&#8217;alreyt?&#8217;. Known on this side of the channel as <em>&#8216;Ca va? Oui ca va et toi? Oui ca vaaaa&#8217;</em>. So easy yet it makes you feel like a boss if you do it in public. Or at least it sort of makes you look French, which is the ultimate goal of course. Ensure that you do the exchange in a French, nonchalant manner. </p>
<p>5. Pretend to be French to a French person on a plane. Or anywhere, for that matter. I somehow managed to pull this off recently despite the fact that my French neighbour heard me speaking English in an impeccable Northern accent to the air hostess, as when he asked me in English if his friend could go to the bathroom I replied <em>&#8216;ouiii bien sur!&#8217;</em> thus leading him for some reason to assume that I was French, and not in fact a clearly English girl just pretending. Badly.</p>
<p>6. Add or be added by a French person on Facebook/Skype/any other thing in this genre. Even if you never talk to them, it seems pretty impressive to have befriended them all the same.</p>
<p>7. Add <em>&#8216;quoi&#8217;</em> on the end of every single sentence you speak. I have assumed (correct me if I&#8217;m wrong) that this is the French equivalent of &#8216;like&#8217;, which I, like, use, like, all the time. Like. Sorry, <em>quoi</em>. </p>
<p>8. <em>Il en va de même pour &#8216;du coup&#8217;</em>. Before coming to France I thought everyone used <em>&#8216;donc&#8217;</em> and <em>&#8216;alors&#8217;</em> in conversation. Although I wasn&#8217;t completely and horrifically wrong, it does seem that most of the people I&#8217;ve conversed with tend to use <em>&#8216;du coup&#8217;</em>, which is apparently too informal to use in essays but still useful enough to be chucked around as often as <em>&#8216;quoi&#8217;</em>. </p>
<p>9. Though technically speaking this one won&#8217;t qualify as pretending to being actually French, as for me it often involves letting the cat out of the bag that I am in fact English and spending my year abroad <em>en France</em>, it is very important to talk to everyone, even people you would usually flee from or at least avert eye contact. I mean, obviously avoid dangerous people, but as for Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses (always friendly, even more so when you accidentally tell them in French that you&#8217;re one too), salespeople, shop assistants, random strangers who don&#8217;t have a creepy glint in their eyes, and so on and so forth. </p>
<p>10. Finally, do not write about or discuss ways of pretending to be French. Sort of gives the game away. Oops. <em>Peu importe</em>, I am English after all, and I can at least be content with the fact that my French and indeed my confidence appears to improved quite a bit this year. Merci la France.</p>]]></content>

    <p>Saint-Emilion is rather spectacular, even when the vineyards are practically dead and covered in snow, and even when the tiny cobbled streets are icy and treacherous and <em>me fait peur</em>, and even when it&#8217;s so cold that one is forced to seek warmth and shelter in incredibly expensive wine shops. In fact the cold was so bad that despite our lovely day out in this pretty little town, we did a wonderful happy dance when the train arrived to take us back to Bordeaux. Note to self: must travel more. <em>Super.</em> </p>]]></content>

    <title>Cinquante-quatre: je suis tellement anglaise, quoi.</title>
    <description></description>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>I honestly didn&#8217;t think that being in France would be all that different from being in England. Apart from the language, slightly better weather (she writes as it is currently snowing in Bordeaux&#8230;) and the fact that I am just not at home, France doesn&#8217;t seem to me to be all that foreign a country.</p>
<p>We were warned at university that we would all experience a bit of a culture shock during our year abroad. The only things that I have noticed thus far, however, are the following:</p>
<p>1. The incessantly creepy men. Who become even creepier when they hear you speaking English, &#8216;hello ladiiiiiies&#8217; and whatnot.</p>
<p>2. The fact that, no matter how I hard I try (n&#8217;importe quoi, you might even say), it is absolutely impossible for me to escape the harsh reality that I am incredibly English, obviously so. Sometimes I can get away with it by putting on a ridiculously overblown French accent but then once a French person looks at me and sees the very clearly English outfit that I am wearing it sort of gives the game away.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t really understand what it is about me that is so typically English. It&#8217;s something that I wasn&#8217;t even aware of before I came to France. Apparently, according to one student at my school, it&#8217;s my ginger hair, but I HAVE seen French ginger people, definitely, because I got very excited and enthusiastic when I did. Or, as a teacher who organises the school newspaper remarked as we looked at a photograph of myself that she had just taken, maybe it&#8217;s the constant flower in my hair that I have become well known for in both my schools and in the foyer where I live. I&#8217;m not sure if many people at all, English or French, wear flowers in their hair on a daily basis to the extent that one&#8217;s hair feels literally naked without a corsage. I can&#8217;t remember when I even started to wear flowers in my hair but now I have a very large collection. Maybe this makes me very English, I honestly do not know.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t really pinpoint the epicentre of my Englishness. But it has got to the point where whenever I meet a new French person or I am excusing a cultural faux pas or something of the like, I use <em>&#8216;je suis tellement anglaise&#8217;</em> as a sort of excuse or even apology. I never really thought I would feel sorry about my nationality, it&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m patriotic, not in the slightest, but I think it would be nice if I was mistaken for being French more often than people realising that I am in fact, very, very English. </p>]]></content>

    <title>cinquante-trois: je reviens a Bordeaux.</title>
    <description></description>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Okay so the title is a bit misleading because I&#8217;ve been back in Bordeaux since New Year&#8217;s Eve, which was a delightfully cheerful affair as I returned to my abode in France alone, armed with a bottle of wine and a meal deal from KFC to find that no one was around in the foyer where I live. Thank goodness for Skype is all I&#8217;ll say.</p>
<p>The first couple of weeks back in Bordeaux were unfortunately not <em>fantastique</em>. It was hard to settle back into things especially as I had enjoyed being home so much. And especially because I found myself with fewer companions here than I had had before, <em>tant pis</em>. Luckily I do have some <em>super</em> friends here, without whom I would, I think it&#8217;s safe to say, be <em>perdue</em>. </p>
<p>School is much the same as before. I have some great students, some terrible students, and some incredibly entertaining students. Such as the boy who decided that everyone was &#8216;beautiful&#8217;, including Patrick Jane from the Mentalist, Wayne Rooney, David Beckham, but thankfully I managed to convince him that David Cameron is definitely not beautiful. There are many more examples of humorous students but I can&#8217;t exactly remember the details, another reason why I should blog more. Especially as I have recently discovered that this blog is useful. <em>Pourquoi?</em></p>
<p>Because I have just updated my CV and I found lots of interesting things that I have done which I have recounted on this thing. I have sent off my CV to numerous translation companies which are slightly more local to <em>chez moi</em> in England so that I won&#8217;t feel like I&#8217;m wasting my summer once my year abroad is over. I am seriously considering a career in translation and I&#8217;m hoping with all my heart that it isn&#8217;t anywhere nearly as boring as I have heard through the grapevine. So here&#8217;s hoping. If so, a masters in translation may be on the cards. <em>On verra</em>. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ll leave you with yet another light-hearted tale from my experiences on the tramway of Bordeaux. Yesterday I was sat on the tram, minding my own business, when a man carrying a small plastic cage and a big bag of hay asked if he could sit opposite me.  I said of course (in French, of course) and he seemed very happy about this. Then he opened the cage ever so slightly and a black furry head popped out. It was a rabbit. Which he proceeded to stroke for the entire journey.</p>
<p>I keep thinking that I&#8217;ve seen and heard it all in Bordeaux. Now I know that this will never be the case.  </p>]]></content>

    <title>cinquante-deux: le francais, partout.</title>
    <description></description>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>As I opened a fresh new tab, promising myself that I will write a new blog post today, I did not expect that tumblr would present itself to me <em>en français</em>.</p>
<p>However, I shouldn&#8217;t have been surprised by this language change. Google also has decided to remind me on a daily basis that I am in France now (not that I really need a reminder thanks, c&#8217;est tellement évident&#8230;) and Amazon, Play and, alas, even Topshop feel the need to redirect me immediately to their French sites before I get the chance to browse for <strike>Christmas presents</strike> something new and shiny to cheer me up. </p>
<p>Not that there is any particular reason why I should complain about this. I can understand French and unlike David Cameron I don&#8217;t have a bizarre aversion to the Euro (mind you, I clearly don&#8217;t have a clue when it comes to the economy. I would on the other hand be very happy if living in France wasn&#8217;t so darned expensive). Nonetheless, it is a little bit disturbing.</p>
<p>Though in all honesty tumblr reverted back to anglais as soon as I logged in with my very much anglais username and password. Hurrah. I think.</p>
<p>This is the main dilemma of my year abroad so far, and frankly if this is the main problem, I think I&#8217;m doing pretty well. Sometimes, it is just too difficult to find oneself in a situation where <em>il faut parler fran</em><em>çais</em>, and then when one does find oneself in such a situation, sometimes it is a bit of a relief when that situation ends and one reverts back to the old comforts of one&#8217;s mother tongue. For instance, most of the English teachers at my school have now decided that I am well and truly settled in Bordeaux (c&#8217;est vrai) and consequently only French must be spoken, all for my benefit of course. This is supremely helpful, except sometimes it is quite difficult to express myself in French and if a teacher can see my frustration whilst trying to find a certain word they will quickly jump to English to help me out. Which truthfully does not help me out in the slightest. I need to have these language struggles if I&#8217;m going to improve, because not being able to find a word in French (a common occurrence) pushes me to find a different word which will do the same job, whereas allowing me to say the word in English is a bit of a cop-out. At the time I might be grateful for said cop-out but in very wise hindsight the whole point of my year abroad is to improve my language. </p>
<p>Further difficulties present themselves due to the fact that I have befriended many English speakers in Bordeaux, fellow assistants and friends from university alike. And none of us have the confidence to speak to each other in the language which we are here to practise. Which is a real shame but at the same time sometimes it&#8217;s nice to have a break or some moral support when confronted by French in a shop, café or restaurant. Nevertheless, yesterday Anishka, Zoe and I felt brave and we played Taboo in French, a game which is no doubt difficult in English nevermind a different language. But it is so useful once you force yourself to use the language that you are trying to learn. I am so worried that I am not improving but I think I must have improved at least a little just by being here in France - maybe that isn&#8217;t enough but the whole experience of my year abroad probably will be.</p>
<p>I will have plenty of time to speak English whilst I am home this time next week. I can&#8217;t wait. To go home that is, not to speak English. I might even speak French whilst I&#8217;m home, though no one will understand me <em>bien sûr</em>. </p>]]></content>

    <div>
<p>So I celebrated my 21st birthday in Bordeaux last weekend, and today it just occurred to me that I have been severely neglecting this blog. This is the result of several factors:</p>
<ol><li>Lack of time. In between lesson planning (ha), essay writing (double ha, even haha) and generally enjoying Bordeaux whilst trying to increase my fluency in French, blogging about everything isn&#8217;t exactly high on my to-do-list. Though in all honesty I don&#8217;t really have a list of things that I need to do, and I have planned lessons for the weeks to come and I have written my essay&#8230; so truthfully, I&#8217;ve just been trying to make the most of my French experience.</li>
<li>Blogging doesn&#8217;t really figure high in my priorities. I am well aware of the fact that not many people will read this. That doesn&#8217;t bother me. In fact, I prefer to write in my journal which only I will ever read (as long as I guard it carefully of course) and consequently there is little motivation to blog as well.</li>
<li>By the time I actually have time and motivation to blog, so much has happened that it&#8217;s impossible to recount it all. So I either vaguely summarise things or I just don&#8217;t bother. For the past few weeks/months/whatever, it has been the case of the latter. </li>
</ol><p>So, to summarise, Bordeaux is great. I have settled in much more than before, my only worry is that my French isn&#8217;t improving vastly. And the time is slipping away. And last weekend was too short. And now I&#8217;m counting down to Christmas.</p>

    <title>cinquante-et-un: les vacances.</title>
    <description></description>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>So after barely three weeks of actual teaching, I am on holiday from school. </p>
<p>Yes, that&#8217;s right, in France they like to do things a little differently when it comes to education. They have crazy long school days here - I mean whoever decided that it was a good idea to start at 8am and finish at 5pm should be force-fed Camembert or some other smelly cheese, though in reality I suppose the person who decided this would actually probably like that, unlike myself. But in order to compensate for this, the French have long school holidays and more of them. So here I am, and I can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;m actually going to say that this Vacances de Toussaints (All Saints to any non-Frenchies) is going really, really fast.</p>
<p>I had so much planned for this week and a half. And some of it has been achieved. Sort of. Here were my original plans for les vacances:</p>
<ol><li>Plan lessons for when I go back to school. A geeky one I know, but I have planned some lessons and it does make me feel slightly less nervous about the return to classes. What does make me feel nervous, however, is the fact that most of the teachers still do not seem to mind what I do with their students. This should make me feel free and whatnot, but this is me after all, so inevitably it makes me fear the worst i.e. failure. Not to worry, I have lessons planned about school uniforms, the Simpsons, the IT Crowd, Coldplay and the classic To Sir With Love to make it interesting - if not for my pupils then at least for me.</li>
<li>Start thinking about my first essay for university. Another geeky one. Turns out I don&#8217;t really need to worry about this too much, but I have been fairly successful in getting articles together and sort of coming up with my essay title. It&#8217;s about the environment, always easy to come up with arguments for that of course.</li>
<li>See more of Bordeaux. The rain has made this one pretty difficult. At the moment Bordeaux is doing a very good impression of English weather. If I had a euro for every time I say &#8220;C&#8217;est comme l&#8217;Angleterre maintenant!" Though really it&#8217;s nowhere near as cold obviously.</li>
<li>Shop. I&#8217;ve done quite a bit of this. Though none of it has been very useful or successful. I have bought one Christmas present, an umbrella (mine broke the first day I used it trying to cross the suddenly very windy Pont de Pierre)&#8230; and that&#8217;s about it. The problem about going shopping here is that it is easy to waste a lot of time looking without getting anything done, resulting in doing the same thing again and again, everyday, and again&#8230; I&#8217;m probably going to go shopping tomorrow.</li>
<li>Travel. It&#8217;s very expensive to travel in France. And to get to Manchester from the south of France for that matter. Hence the lack of travelling, which I hope to rectify as soon as possible. </li>
</ol><p>And that&#8217;s about it. The plans have been semi-successful, but despite this I&#8217;ve had a good vacances so far. I&#8217;ve been on the big wheel at the fair and saw Bordeaux from up above, I&#8217;ve been to an Irish bar and sang karaoke and drank wine, I visited an English teacher&#8217;s house and had a real French meal (foie gras, aperitifs, macaroons and all) and I&#8217;ve got together my Halloween outfit, in which my obsession with Hello Kitty will reach its inevitable conclusion.</p>
<p>I do love Bordeaux. I also love that it&#8217;s less than a month until Martin and my parents arrive. </p>]]></content>

    <title>cinquante: au revoir le soleil, bonjour les eleves.</title>
    <description></description>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>The sun has disappeared, just in time for me to avoid teaching my students whilst sweating like the typical English girl I am (apparently).</p>
<p>Yes, I have officially begun teaching&#8230; sort of. In fact, on Monday I was supposed to have four hours of lessons. But all my lessons were cancelled or the students simply didn&#8217;t show up. Except for two girls who turned up for a class I have where I should have four students, so I left school on Monday slightly content with the fact that I had taught two students that I like reading books and yes, most English people aren&#8217;t bothered about learning another language BECAUSE HONESTLY WHAT IS THE POINT.</p>
<p>Successful, yes.</p>
<p>But today was much more rewarding. Although I had to wake up at six to get to school for eight (because for some strange reason French schools feel that it is necessary to have an 8-5 school day, I still do not understand this) this meant that my fear of having to teach or worse having no one to teach was suppressed by my need to suppress my sleepiness. I also only have one hour of teaching time on Wednesday (8-9, yes I know) but although the English teachers at my school feel bad that I have to wake up so early just for one hour I don&#8217;t actually mind it, I would rather have just the one hour early on in the day rather than at the end of the day. And plus I only have twelve hours of teaching time altogether so really I would be forever known as the awkward and annoying English assistant from the north but without a real northern accent (apparently) if I dared to complain. So I don&#8217;t, and I don&#8217;t need to. </p>
<p>So my hour of teaching today. The topic was CCTV cameras, and I was with a group of 16-17 year olds who are quite good at English (they&#8217;re in the equivalent of the English Gifted and Talented scheme, or something like that). They were very very quiet at first. My questions such as &#8216;So what have you been learning about CCTV cameras?&#8217; elicited very little response apart from blank stares. Except for one girl with an inexplicable American accent who put her hand up sheepishly every time I asked a question.</p>
<p>BUT by the end of the lesson somehow there was a full on debate about CCTV cameras raging in the classroom, and one girl even asked me if I felt &#8216;oppressed&#8217; because apparently there&#8217;s over 4 million CCTV cameras in the UK. Honestly I&#8217;ve barely even noticed them. Which doesn&#8217;t figure well with the argument they have learnt that CCTV takes away the liberty of the people. I never even see these cameras or know that they are there. Although today was a good opportunity to mention the riots we had over the summer, I knew they would make good teaching material. </p>
<p>Aside from teaching, Bordeaux is still an amazing city. But yes, I&#8217;m still homesick and missing my man. I don&#8217;t think that will ever change. Yet I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll ever get an opportunity like this again. I need to enjoy it, and I am doing. Despite everything being crazy expensive here. Despite it being near impossible to get a direct flight from Bordeaux to anywhere in the north of England (damn you London, why do I live nowhere near you?). Despite those horrible moments I get every now and then of doubt then fear then desire to run away home as soon as possible. It&#8217;s still really good here, and teaching is not too shabby either. I&#8217;ll never get to work twelve hours again&#8230; which is a depressing thought. To counteract this negativity here&#8217;s a final thought: I wouldn&#8217;t want to be anywhere else in France.</p>]]></content>

    <p>A few snapshots from my traumatic first week of living in Bordeaux sans parents et sans Martin. However, despite my crippling homesickness and worries, I am starting to appreciate the beauty of this amazing city and so I wanted to share it here. Hopefully more photos will follow, and so will less pain and more enjoyment. I know I will always feel homesick and miss my boyfriend, but goodness knows I&#8217;m lucky to be here and I need to make the most of it. I will have times where I will question why I am here and wish that I could just go home, just for a little while, but I need to keep going. And I will.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s to positivity. Here&#8217;s to Bordeaux. </p>]]></content>

    <title>quarante-neuf: Je suis a Bordeaux.</title>
    <description></description>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Well I&#8217;ve arrived. And so let my year abroad (technically around seven months) commence.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always struggled with the term &#8216;have the time of your life&#8217;. I was supposed to experience this term when I began university. But I didn&#8217;t. I mean, I enjoy university, and it&#8217;s a good experience and it&#8217;s worthwhile and everything, but certain things get in the way which I never expected when I originally applied. For example, homesickness. Furthermore, when I applied for university I was <em>sans Martin</em> so I did not foresee struggling to cope with the sadness of maintaining a long distance relationship. However, I managed, and after two years at the University of Warwick, I couldn&#8217;t exactly say that I&#8217;d had the time of my life (it sounds like I&#8217;m quoting Dirty Dancing now, great) but I could say that I had enjoyed it and could certainly do another year of it. I&#8217;d made friends and been pretty successful too.</p>
<p>However, now another brand new situation has presented itself. It too is another experience where one would say that I should &#8216;have the time of my life&#8217;, but instead now I should owe it all to Bordeaux. I&#8217;ve decided to take this cliché to the full Dirty Dancing level; I might as well, consider it a homage to Patrick Swazye.  The past summer I have denied to myself and to others (without their realising it of course) that I would actually end up coming to France to live here for seven months. But finally Saturday arrived, and I had to fly away by myself. </p>
<p>It was horrific.</p>
<p>I knew it would be tough, but I can&#8217;t even begin to explain how I felt, or even how I&#8217;m still feeling a little bit. I&#8217;m struggling to eat and sleep, but surprisingly enough the whole doing everything in French aspect isn&#8217;t quite as scary as I had feared. Everything else, on the other hand, is very overwhelming. I have to get a French bank account, a French mobile, and I don&#8217;t have internet in my room - which has resulted in me resorting to using Skype in the communal Internet Room, where I constantly make a fool of myself by laughing at my boyfriend as he mimics the custom of greeting everyone once you enter or leave a room. Bonjour indeed. To continue my petit rant, the supermarkets are expensive and I have no idea what I want to cook, especially as I don&#8217;t feel like eating at the moment. When I go to a supermarket, I get flashbacks of my first week at university when I went into Tesco, panicked, bought a pizza and left nearly in tears. The French supermarkets haven&#8217;t quite reduced me to tears, but then again even I have enough self control to not cry in public places. Most of the time. </p>
<p>It sounds like I&#8217;m having a terrible time, which is not the impression I wish to give. Because no matter how hard it gets, it will get better and I will do this. I need to do this. I want to do this. I know that once I settle down a bit, things will get easier and before I know it this year will be over. I need to make it count. And in all fairness, I am incredibly lucky to be here in the centre of Bordeaux. It&#8217;s a beautiful city (I will post photos soon, I keep forgetting to take my camera with me when I go out) and it&#8217;s not too big or threatening, like Paris or London for example. Basically, it&#8217;s an amazing place, and it&#8217;s frustrating that I can&#8217;t fully appreciate it at the moment. I am way too sensitive sometimes, and I just need to get tougher. </p>
<p>Besides, everyone here in Bordeaux is absolutely lovely. I am staying at a foyer in the centre, which is a place for young people to live who are studying or working and can&#8217;t afford a flat. The staff have had language assistants stay with them before and they are very helpful. The teachers at my school are really kind as well - even the headmistress told me to talk to her whenever I felt sad! The headmistress also has a pug dog which sniffed my feet when I went into her office, c&#8217;est bizarre. I have also been told that I look very English. I don&#8217;t know how I have managed this or whether it&#8217;s a compliment or an insult. So much for trying to blend in whilst I&#8217;m here. </p>
<p>I want to end this on a positive note. Frankly, I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ll have the time of my life here in Bordeaux, but right now I&#8217;m not in the right frame of mind to judge. I don&#8217;t see why I can&#8217;t though; I just need to settle down and worry less. I should adopt this mantra in general I reckon. </p>]]></content>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>I forgot to mention that I have a new laptop.</p>
<p>Not that this is of major interest to anyone but myself really. I just like proclaiming that I have a laptop which decides to work just as I like it to now.</p>
<p>In all fairness to its predecessor, Laptop 1.0 was a very trusty specimen, until it let that Trojan Horse through the gates (I still have no idea where that came from). Oh Laptop 1.0, you shall never be forgotten, after four years of service, you did alright, kudos.</p>
<p>But Laptop 2.0, you are magnificent.</p>
<p>I had forgotten that a laptop is supposed to turn on and off when you tell it to, rather than making you wait for an eternity, by either installing 218946735693275 updates or just deciding that it really doesn&#8217;t fancy working right now, sorry to be an inconvenience of course.</p>
<p>I had forgotten that the keyboard of a laptop is supposed to feel nice whilst you&#8217;re typing, rather than clunky and sticky&#8230; though to be fair the latter is probably more my fault than the laptop&#8217;s; it&#8217;s not its fault that I like to eat ice cream/chocolate/some other assorted junk whilst typing away/surfing the web like Spiderman/watching some other assorted junk. Sorry, Laptop 1.0, let us pray that Laptop 2.0 will not be the victim of a similar fate.</p>
<p>I had forgotten that a laptop is supposed to automatically connect to the internet once it is turned on, rather than making you wait for an undetermined period of time because it just doesn&#8217;t like it if you press the wireless button too early. </p>
<p>I can only hope that this apparently amazing laptop (I say this sceptically because I&#8217;m rather wary of technology now, understandably of course) does not lead me into a false sense of security with its superior qualities and then self-destruct when I need it most (i.e. the week before my exams kick off, thanks again a bunch Laptop 1.0). I especially hope this because this laptop will be accompanying me to France for seven months, therefore it needs to survive. I can&#8217;t deal with technicians in English, heaven forbid in French. If the English technician at university winked at me, goodness knows what his French equivalent might do. Perish the thought etc. </p>
<p>Hopefully my new Hello Kitty laptop sleeve will protect Laptop 2.0 in transit, but what about lurking Trojan Horses? I don&#8217;t even want to think about it. </p>
<p>By the way, did I mention that Laptop 2.0 is pink and shiny? Cheeky bonus.</p>]]></content>

    <p>Majorca was amazing.</p>
<p>I somehow got a first overall in my second year of university.</p>
<p>Now I need to find somewhere to live in Bordeaux, which is near impossible. Luckily French people are very nice if you&#8217;ve called the wrong number, which is good for someone like me who hates calling people on the phone whether I have to speak in English or French.</p>
<p>I want to run away to Majorca again or somewhere where there&#8217;s cheap cocktails and I don&#8217;t have to worry about teaching and living in France. I want to be excited about Bordeaux and I know I will be, as soon as all this organising business gets out of the way.</p>
<p>I have a feeling that this summer will disappear in front of my very eyes, just like our holiday did.</p>]]></content>

    <title>Quarante-sept: a l'ecole.</title>
    <description></description>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>I can&#8217;t believe it but I think I actually would love to be a teacher.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t believe it but I think I actually may like children after all. Once you try to teach them French and they enjoy it and they take a liking to you children can be incredibly sweet; something which I had never considered before. I&#8217;ve never been all that good at dealing with children but this week (so far anyway) it&#8217;s been going so well. To the extent that a few girls gave me hugs as they left the classroom this afternoon at the end of the school day. I suddenly thought that maybe children aren&#8217;t so bad after all.</p>

<p>Yesterday I visited every class in the primary school which my man&#8217;s mum works at (which is the reason as to why I have managed to acquire this work experience in the first place), and I was amazed by how lovely these children all are. I can barely remember being at primary school myself (it scares me to think how long ago it was) but I can sort of recall how difficult yet how fun it felt at the time. I think that&#8217;s how these children find it; everything seems to excite them but it&#8217;s clear that they find things tough sometimes too.</p>

<p>They have no idea.</p>

<p>The rest of the day I planned my sessions for the week for teaching the children French. Today I taught year 3 about the weather in French, and I used this song which is insanely catchy/infuriating and which I have heard about 235899530903236 times today alone. The children loved it though which is the main thing. They really seem to enjoy being able to learn another language which amazes me so much and equally impresses me too. It&#8217;s a shame that they don&#8217;t have the chance to do more French, and I have so enjoyed teaching them. I hope the rest of the week will be just as productive and enjoyable.</p>

<p>It has really boosted my confidence too, this whole experience. I&#8217;ve done session plans which the teachers and even headmistress were impressed with, I&#8217;ve had children today desperate not to leave my table francaise because they&#8217;ve enjoyed the French activities so much, and I&#8217;ve had both teachers and children lamenting the fact that they only have this week to use me to further their understanding of French. It&#8217;s great to feel useful and successful but it&#8217;s just as great to feel that children actually do enjoy learning languages - something which I think is so important to encourage, especially from an early age. That&#8217;s partly why I&#8217;m considering teaching French after university.</p>

<p>Either way, on a more cynical note, this week will be extremely beneficial for my CV in the future. Which can&#8217;t be a bad thing; especially if I&#8217;m relishing the experience in the process.</p>]]></content>

    <description></description>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Finally finished my exams now and I&#8217;m back home and I almost feel better about things; I should feel great because I&#8217;ve bagged myself some work experience and next week I&#8217;m going on holiday with my man but next week my results will emerge from my university and it turns out that I&#8217;m absolutely terrified of failure.</p>

<p>But I&#8217;m trying not to think about it right now. This week I&#8217;m going to be attempting to teach primary school children French (which could be interesting as I have no idea how to teach or how advanced primary school children are in their acquisition of foreign languages though I&#8217;m guessing not very much). This is quite exciting and a little bit scary, though nowhere near as scary as the thought of failing of course.</p>

<p>Just trying to remain positive now. Which is made incredibly easier just by being at home.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve had the best weekend and it&#8217;s not even over yet.</p>]]></content>

    <description></description>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>It has just occurred to me that I am terrified of failure.</p>
<p>I am more worried about my exam results than doing my actual exams. There&#8217;s something not right there.</p>
<p>At least this time next week I&#8217;ll be home and it&#8217;ll be easier not to worry about pointless things there.</p>
<p>Aside from all this negativity, today&#8217;s exam went quite well actually. It was only an hour long and I had to write about a French Romantic novel (as in the period and not actually filled with romance, just because it&#8217;s French doesn&#8217;t mean&#8230; it usually does though in all fairness). It wasn&#8217;t terrible. I came out of the exam feeling quite relieved, if only for a little while.</p>
<p>My next exam is tomorrow morning. Yes, I have an exam on a Saturday morning. Ridiculous I know. But it&#8217;s only an hour long and then after that I only have one more exam that actually counts towards my degree this year. So that&#8217;s something I guess.</p>]]></content>

    <description></description>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Well, my laptop is back. Sort of.</p>
<p>The university IT technician managed to wipe everything and do things to my laptop that I will not pretend to understand. He also refused my money and winked at me. This is slightly concerning but I am a student after all; when I see a bargain I take it and run away with my laptop case towards the bus stop.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, my parents have decided that this decrepit old thing is no longer any good for my laptop-ing needs, so they are going to buy me a new one - woe betide me if I&#8217;m stuck in France next year trying to woo a French IT technician into restoring my laptop yet again, so it&#8217;s fair enough really. They will keep this old but faithful friend (well, faithful until last Friday at least). It&#8217;s actually a lot faster now that there&#8217;s nothing on it. Go figure.</p>
<p>In other news, I don&#8217;t want to do my exams. I would like them to be over now. I would like to be on a plane to Majorca now. Counting down the days. I am literally marking them off on my calendar. My man says it&#8217;s like I&#8217;m in prison. He&#8217;s quite good with analogies, on the whole.</p>]]></content>

    <title>quarante-trois: l'ordinateur.</title>
    <description></description>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>For the first time in the four years that I have possessed this very slow yet very reliable laptop, it has failed me. In the dark of the night a virus has taken hold of it, seeping through my laptop&#8217;s system, and thus rendering it even more useless than it was before.</p>
<p>Cue extreme panic.</p>
<p>I genuinely thought I had lost everything: university work, music and photos, the latter being the most distressing thought. I rushed my laptop to the engineer at university, and after two and a half painstaking hours I returned to find my files had all been saved, but my laptop had been savaged and left unrecognisable.</p>
<p>I have now backed up all my files. I felt a bit like Carrie Bradshaw in that episode of Sex and the City where her laptop dies and she never backed up her work and everyone says &#8216;Why didn&#8217;t you back anything up? You&#8217;re an idiot.&#8217; (or words to that effect, seems plausible to me) and then Aidan buys her a brand new shiny MacBook which she hates because it isn&#8217;t <em>her</em> laptop, it&#8217;s just a replacement for something she can&#8217;t fully replace (though to be fair, she should appreciate it instead of going into crazy-Carrie mode, does she realize how much one of those things cost?).</p>
<p>Yes, I now empathise with this annoying fictional character (although as much as I call her annoying, I still watch the darn program constantly, hypocritical I know), because even though now all of my precious files have been saved and backed up onto discs - though I don&#8217;t trust them, my laptop or myself anymore - my laptop just isn&#8217;t right. There&#8217;s not much to it, and there&#8217;s not much I can do with it either, seeing as the virus has brutally exposed it&#8217;s weaknesses i.e. slowness, lack of memory, general usefulness, etc, etc, etc. I don&#8217;t really know what to do with it, in all honesty. I don&#8217;t think I have the CD anywhere that would allow me to do a factory reset, and although the university can do this for me for thirty British pounds, I&#8217;m not sure that such a drastic method would improve my laptop in the slightest or make me feel comfortable with it once more.</p>
<p>It aggravates me that technology gets under my skin like this, and that I&#8217;ve come to rely so much on this piece of equipment. I try not to trust any person too much, so why do I trust a machine so much? Well, not anymore I suppose.</p>
<p>So now I have arrived at an impasse. Should I discard this old, admittedly decrepit laptop now that it&#8217;s become obvious that it&#8217;s no longer enough to cope with my laptopp-ing needs? Or should I just find a way to format it (or something else technology-fied that I really, really don&#8217;t understand, thankfully my man knows about these things otherwise I&#8217;d be a tad lost, go feminism and all that) and keep something that has been reliable for so long up until yesterday?</p>
<p>After all, I suppose it&#8217;s only a laptop. But really, letting me down in the midst of my exams? Don&#8217;t appreciate it thanks. Maybe it&#8217;s time to get a brand-new shiny one instead. I, unlike Carrie, would be grateful.</p>]]></content>

</figure></div>

    <p>On Saturday I gave Pikachu a big hug. Or, perhaps more accurately, I gave a questionable person dressed in a Pikachu suit a big hug.</p>
<p>But this is not the reason why I suddenly feel better, albeit marginally, about my exams.</p>
<p>Martin came to visit me in grim Coventry. We went to a Pokemon tournament in Birmingham with his brother Chris and his girlfriend Charl, and it was such a good day; just what I needed to get over myself and get over how stressed I have been recently. Lately I keep getting this unstoppable sick feeling right from the pit of my stomach, and nothing, not even yoga, not even finishing an exam, and not even the thought of the end being near with our holiday in sight was enough to quell and banish the feeling at all.</p>
<p>But this weekend it seemed to disappear entirely.</p>
<p>After cocktails and pool with Martin and friends (Sarah, Fi and Tom to be precise) I felt even better, and even yesterday when the thought of Martin leaving at any given moment usually haunts me relentlessly for hours (I&#8217;m such a girl. It&#8217;s frustrating at times) I managed to stay relatively calm and just enjoy my weekend off with my man. And even now that he&#8217;s gone and that I have to return to revising French and novels and such, I feel relieved and I can almost feel the end within my grasp. Lately I have been feeling disillusioned and in despair over my future which seems to lack direction. But now I&#8217;ve finally realised that thinking like that will get me nowhere. I need to get through one day at a time. I need to enjoy the present and stop worrying about the future.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve made it sound so easy. Sometimes I wish I didn&#8217;t worry so much. Sometimes I wish I didn&#8217;t think too much. Sometimes I wish I didn&#8217;t feel down so much.</p>
<p>But I can&#8217;t change.</p>]]></content>

    <title>quarante-deux: en trois semaines.</title>
    <description></description>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>In three weeks my exams will be over.</p>
<p>In three weeks I will be at home.</p>
<p>In three weeks my nightmare will end.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know why I&#8217;m so anxious lately. I keep making spider diagrams for revision (apparently it&#8217;s a useful method. It&#8217;s just driving me insane), but instead the diagrams are forming in my mind, one worry branches off into 3 more worries, and so on and so forth. It&#8217;s exhausting.</p>
<p>I never used to get so worried about exams. I don&#8217;t really know what has changed.</p>
<p>France keeps looming.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t seem to get rid of the sick feeling I have. I&#8217;m not sure how my exam went on Tuesday but it didn&#8217;t feel good. I used to come out of exams feeling relieved. Not anymore.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m tired of complaining about it. But I&#8217;m equally tired of trying to think positive, it doesn&#8217;t work very well. I can&#8217;t help but think that I&#8217;m not very good at this degree, and at the end of it it&#8217;s not going to count for much anyway.</p>
<p>Such a depressing thought. At least the sun is out today. At least it will be the holidays soon. At least it&#8217;s nearly over.</p>]]></content>

    <title>quarante et un: les examens rendent Claire triste.</title>
    <description></description>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>My mind is foggy and my stomach is churning, churning.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t believe that I ever stressed out about my first year of university, the lovely, blissful year where not one iota of work you do really counts, not towards your degree anyway. Whereas now, reaching the climax of my second year where absolutely everything counts so you better do <em>fantastic</em>&#8230; I&#8217;m flailing.</p>
<p>Just so long as I&#8217;m not failing.</p>
<p>My first exam of the year is on Tuesday. Modernist Cultures is the wonderful typically English literary title for this wonderful typically English literary module. I remember last year so well, the time when we had to choose our modules and I was so excited by the prospect of studying Woolf, Lawrence, Rhys, Forster and the like. I was even more excited by the possibility that twelve months later I would be able to boast proudly of the fact that not only had I read and studied Ulysses, that gorgeous masterpiece of 900 pages or so of interior monologues and parody and pastiche, but I actually <em>understood</em> it.</p>
<p>This is why I have come to learn that having great expectations is merely a set up for future disappointments. Mind you, reading about Pip should have taught me that already.</p>
<p>Consequently at the moment I cannot remember for the life in me why I ever thought this module would be such a good idea. I have enjoyed it, absolutely, I can&#8217;t fault <em>Jacob&#8217;s Room</em> or <em>Howards End</em>, and whereas I may have some issues undoubtedly concerning <em>Women in Love </em>and it&#8217;s ridiculously atrocious characters who make me lose all faith in humanity and make me physically nauseous, in revising the novel I am genuinely, finally starting to recognise its appeal with a brain-revolving epiphany that surely Lawrence would be pleased about. Even Ulysses, with its undeniable chaos and confusion, has made more sense than I could have ever imagined when I first began reading it last summer in an attempt to get ahead for this year.</p>
<p><em>Alors, quel est le problème?</em></p>
<p>The fact is, I have an exam on Tuesday about all of these things. And an exam is a test of one&#8217;s ability, so they say. And no matter how much I revise, or how much people tell me that I will be fine, nothing is comforting right now. All I can think is, I have an exam on the most crucial modernist texts the world has known and I&#8217;m not sure that I know enough about them. But how much could I ever possibly know about any novel - in particular the jaw-dropping, immensely intimidating enterprise by Joyce?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think I will ever feel confident about this exam, or about any exam for that matter. It&#8217;s always been in my nature to be a perfectionist, to yearn to succeed, and to be terrified that I am not good enough in general. I know that a vast number of people are experiencing the same sort of thing as I am at the moment (although many of my friends have already finished their exams and are ready for the &#8216;summer&#8217;, how lucky, except that it&#8217;s nearly June and it looks like November today), so although I feel irrepressibly lonely I am not alone. Leopold Bloom writes I AM A on the beach in <em>Ulysses</em>, and leaves the sentence unfinished (or so it seems); I too feel that I cannot quite fully express my utter and complete dread at the moment. I can only hope that once this exam is over, the rest will follow accordingly, and so it will all be over, for now.</p>
<p>And besides, my inability to communicate is one of the biggest modernist fears concerning the inadequacy of language. Surely that will gain me some bonus points with the examiner.</p>]]></content>

    <title>quarante: des grandes angoisses.</title>
    <description></description>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been back and forth from university and home and now I&#8217;m back in Coventry and it&#8217;s grim.</p>
<p>Not just because the weather is bleak, not just because I find this city utterly dismal, but because my first exam is next Tuesday and I&#8217;m terrified, simply because I cannot remember why I thought studying Ulysses was ever a good idea.</p>
<p>And also there&#8217;s the small matter of the fact that I&#8217;ve lost complete confidence in myself and my abilities.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m holding on to the thought of six weeks from now, when my man and I shall be in Majorca and it will be sunny and exams will be far, far away. I won&#8217;t even have to think about France, for a while.</p>
<p>But for now, I&#8217;m just going to have to work really, really hard. And grin and bear it through Ulysses: because really, once who know which interior monologue belongs to who, it&#8217;s not that bad. Just wish there wasn&#8217;t 900 pages of it, that doesn&#8217;t help much.</p>]]></content>

<p>Starting to hate revising this book now. Imperialism is not for the faint-hearted. I&#8217;d much rather revise this:</p>

    <p>Lovely walk along the canal near my house last evening, took Martin to see the horses and the rabbits and the ducks. Hence the look of immense hubris all over my face.</p>
<p>The weather has been exceptional the last few days, seems too good to be true. I may have even scored a tan today, cheeky bonus.</p>
<p>Bought some lovely peach brogue-type pumps and a dress and a playsuit for the summer holiday. Exciting stuff.</p>
<p>I say lovely quite a lot. As words go, it&#8217;s not even the best of them.</p>]]></content>

    <title>trente-huit: beaucoup de pongistes.</title>
    <description></description>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>I honestly don&#8217;t know how Martin managed to play two full days of table tennis this weekend, whereas I&#8217;m absolutely shattered from just sitting there watching him.</p>
<p>Mind you, I did a good job of throwing stray table tennis balls back to players, judging them by their reactions in the process. There&#8217;s probably a job title for that sort of thing but I&#8217;m not fully aware of it.</p>
<p>However, I have definitely transformed into some sort of a table tennis groupie. I would prefer the title of cheerleader but I think my mum threw away my pom-poms some time ago.</p>
<p>Anyway, <a href="http://mawyatt.com">Martin</a> was playing in the Blackpool Open this weekend, and he decided bravely to participate in both days whereas previously, whenever I&#8217;ve been to support him anyway, he&#8217;s usually only taken part in the first day. Getting up at 6am on a Saturday and on a Sunday is not my usual idea of fun, but I&#8217;m starting to fair enjoy watching table tennis now. Compared to some other sports, it&#8217;s much more exciting, and it&#8217;s pretty quick too which is always a bonus for someone like me who doesn&#8217;t really have much patience for sport.</p>
<p>He did really well, trying his best as always, and we met some interesting characters along the way.</p>
<p>For instance.</p>
<p>Sulky Jackson 5 boy (I&#8217;m not sure exactly which member of the Jackson 5, but he could have passed for any of them I&#8217;m sure). I don&#8217;t think this young man has learnt how to smile yet, and he certainly didn&#8217;t smile when Martin beat him either.</p>
<p>Retro tracksuit guy, who Martin didn&#8217;t actually play but we admired his 1980&#8217;s garments from afar. Bright pink, purple and luminous green DO NOT mix, but they do not affect your table tennis skills, fact.</p>
<p>French/student guy, as in he looks like he could be French yet he equally looks like he could be a student, but not a student of French (we presumed that he is probably studying English Literature with Philosophy, he just has that look). Martin actually played against this guy at Doncaster in February (at least I think it was then&#8230;) and we similarly mocked him then as well. To be fair, in between matches there is not much else we can do except for table tennis people watching. To be honest, I think I prefer French guy to Scottish guy, who was so incredibly sarcastic it bordered on sheer confusion. Some people just won&#8217;t let you play Fruit Ninja in peace whilst you&#8217;re trying to pass the time when your boyfriend is umpiring a table tennis match that you&#8217;re not too bothered about. Jeez.</p>
<p>This was also the weekend of the headbands. Two players wore sweat-headbands (no, I didn&#8217;t even know they existed either) which added to their extreme intensity whilst playing. Terrifying. One had crazy tattoos about their &#8220;beloved" (wish I was joking) whilst the other also works in the administration of the tournament itself, and so when he arrived to play Martin the surprise was astronomical - probably had something to do with the fact that we were also delirious from sleep deprivation. The latter guy also mysteriously knows Martin very well, which is slightly disturbing seeing as hundreds of people enter these tournaments&#8230;</p>
<p>Most of the players at this tournament were grateful whenever I returned their stray ball so they could continue their game; however some were just plain disrespectful, how dare they. One guy actually managed to give me a dirty look, not once, but twice.</p>
<p>Ridiculous.</p>
<p>I seemed to be the only girlfriend in tow at this tournament, which prompted one of Martin&#8217;s opponents to question my sanity. Thankfully, however, I am nothing like the only other girlfriend I spotted, who instead of trying to cheer up her partner after he lost, merely told him bluntly that he was right, he should have won that match. Unnecessary. She also seemed to possess a lot of technical knowledge about the game that I simply do not understand, but surely that&#8217;s not an excuse to belittle someone you&#8217;re supposed to be there to support in the first place?</p>
<p>Maybe it&#8217;s just me, but I don&#8217;t think that winning is the be-all and end-all of anything. Without sounding trite, I&#8217;m proud of Martin just because he worked so hard this weekend. I don&#8217;t think I would ever be able to be as dedicated to something, aside from reading and writing, as even with those hobbies my passion is dwindling.</p>
<p>In other news, I feel tremendously ill. And I can&#8217;t believe that a week tomorrow I&#8217;ll be heading back to Coventry. Although I will be back home momentarily soon after, I suppose.</p>]]></content>

    <title>trente-sept: bonjour chat.</title>
    <description></description>
    <content><![CDATA[<p><img height="201" width="281" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ljpcamOIcq1qhda8g.jpg" align="right"/>The friendly neighbourhood cat loves our house quite a lot. Resulting in his tendency to hang from our doorframe when he wants to get in, also known as &#8216;please feed me, I&#8217;m a cute cat after all&#8217;.</p>
<p>Fred is an exceptional name for a cat, if I may say so myself.</p>
<p>By the way, I named him.</p>
<p>He belongs to our next-door neighbours, as in a cruel twist of fate I am allergic to cats, despite the fact that I really, really would love to have a cat. But I can&#8217;t. So when he was found prowling around our backstreets he was adopted by our significantly less allergic neighbours. However, Fred has an interesting rapport with my mum, so he often perches his very round self at our doorway, hoping to score shelter or a meal. He&#8217;s quite difficult to resist, and if it wasn&#8217;t for the fact that he makes me itchy/sneezy/insert-one-of-the-seven-dwarves-names-here, I would quite happily let him in whenever he corners us at the door.</p>
<p>Spring has brought pollen, even though the weather still isn&#8217;t great. The subsequent hayfever-related reactions are quite distracting when I&#8217;m trying to revise or edit my essays. I&#8217;ve given up trying to be confident about essays now; I&#8217;ve done my best and now I&#8217;m just going to forget about it. Exams are looming then second year is over; I can&#8217;t believe how quickly the time is passing.</p>
<p>Heard from the British Council today. My application for my language assistantship in France has been approved and now I&#8217;m just waiting somewhat apprehensively for the French authorities to decide whereabouts I will be teaching English to French kids.</p>
<p>Please let it be Bordeaux. And please let them decide <em>rapidement.</em></p>]]></content>

<p>Also fairly smitten with Friendly Fires&#8217; new song, <em>Live Those Days Tonight</em>, but then again anything they do is utter genius.</p>
<p>Bought even more clothes today, but it was necessary. Spring was definitely lacking in my wardrobe, though spring is also fairly lacking in the weather at the moment in all honesty. It&#8217;s been far too cold and dreary for far too long.</p>
<p>Going to attempt to defeat Martin in an epic game of Monoplay tonight. Attempt being the operative word.</p>      ]]></content>

    <p>Had a major House marathon today with my wonderful cousin Rebecca. Watched about eight episodes, my eyes are now even squarer than they were before. This latest series has gone slightly insane, what with a dream sequence episode that is reminscent of Two and a Half Men, Resident Evil and a Lady Gaga music video. Odd mix.</p>

<p>Currently watching Martin play table tennis. I can barely hit the ball. Sport isn&#8217;t exactly my strongest suit.</p>]]></content>

Luckily for me I doubt that anyone reads these things, otherwise my audience would be severely disappointed. Hopefully my plan is to completely redo this whole blogging thing in time for my year abroad, which is edging closer and closer as I type. This time next year, however, my time in France should be pretty much over. My theory is that if I really made an effort to blog about my time over there it could be extremely useful and posssibly even interesting for other people to read, if I&#8217;m lucky. <br/><br/>In the meantime?<br/><br/>It&#8217;s the Easter holidays for me at the moment, and it has been for a few weeks now. University has been pretty hectic this year, with 5000 word essays, 2500 word essays, getting trains back and forth, reading, more reading and finding time to escape from the chaos. My essays for the entire academic year are almost finished, then the exams will arrive, but at the end of it all Martin and I will be going to Majorca, which I am incredibly excited about.<br/><br/>Then it will be France time.<br/><br/>I&#8217;m not as scared as I was before. Things are definitely improving. Growing up is hard to do but it&#8217;s not impossible. I&#8217;m managing a bit more everyday.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3012329592241943967-4990636436566945347?l=clairepoof.blogspot.com" alt=""/></div>]]></content>

    <title>trente-cinq: trop tard.</title>
    <description></description>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve said it a million times before, but I really cannot keep up with this blog. I just completely forget about it, which is a shame because I had so much free time this summer and I just re-read my last entry about the Doncaster Open, and it made me laugh even if no one else on the interweb is bothered. I just can&#8217;t believe that that happened last summer, which was a hazy dream that sometimes bored me to tears and sometimes elevated me beyond the natural realms of ecstasy. <br/><br/>But I&#8217;m back at Warwick. In Coventry to be more precise.<br/><br/>This year is slightly different. Easier in some ways, harder in others.<br/><br/><strong>Easier</strong>: we&#8217;re in a house. Much more homely, I don&#8217;t feel as alone as I did last year somehow. But then there are occasional times when I&#8217;m sat in my room and it feels just like Claycroft and I feel like I&#8217;m drowning, that awful suffocating feeling that you just can&#8217;t shake off and translating French or reading Flaubert just does not help in the slightest<br/><br/><strong>Harder</strong>: we&#8217;re in a house that isn&#8217;t on campus. Consequently we have to deal with buses. I quite like buses but I don&#8217;t trust Coventry ones. Not only do you have to have the exact change at all times (not a problem with my bus pass but nevertheless) but seeing as they head towards the university they are often majorly packed. Which is wonderful when you&#8217;re in a hurry. Fortunately I am the most prepared young lady of my generation so I am always an hour early for absolutely everything, wow I&#8217;m so cool.<br/><br/><strong>Easier</strong>: I&#8217;m a uni veteran now. I&#8217;ve kind of got used to the heart pangs and the nausea that accompagnies trop de travail. I can cook and I can clean and I can take care of myself. <br/><br/><strong>Harder</strong>: still doesn&#8217;t make missing Martin and the family any easier. I&#8217;m more settled but every now and then I still burn, and then I have to organise next year en France and it scares me more than a little. But I picked this degree; in all honesty I need to do this. It will help me so much. The work at university is also evidently harder, which was to be expected but maybe not to the extent that we&#8217;ve all encountered. Luckily I&#8217;m quite paranoid about studying and I like to get as far ahead as humanly possible with work etc. Makes it a little easier on myself.<br/><br/>I really am going to try and make an effort. If not now then definitely when I head out to France, I can imagine that it would be a useful memento. As I keep saying, just have to keep plodding away</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3012329592241943967-1080177205910196464?l=clairepoof.blogspot.com" alt=""/></div>]]></content>

    <title>trente-quatre: des pongistes et des lecteurs.</title>
    <description></description>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>So ridiculously close to averaging a first in my first year of university. But I passed, and frankly, for my first year that was full of upsets and traumas, that should be good enough. Unfortunately, I&#8217;m a perfectionist.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. And now I&#8217;m free to enjoy my summer, which has so far been filled with reading, days out and spending time with family, friends and Martin. Until Saturday, when we encountered les pongistes.<br/><br/>Table tennis is way cooler than ordinary tennis. For one, you don&#8217;t really get any overly epic matches in table tennis, i.e. boring rallies which carry on for hours, as was seen in Wimbledon this year. I just can&#8217;t cope with that kind of thing. Luckily for me, my boyfriend prefers the version played on tables, which is much more exciting and doesn&#8217;t drag on for an eternity. In fact, watching him play at the Doncaster Open last Saturday was one of the only times in my life that I&#8217;ve actually enjoyed watching a sport. Usually I just don&#8217;t get it<br/><br/>It did incite me to commit murder though.<br/><br/>The object of my homicidal intentions was a highly irritating coach of a kid that <a href="http://www.mawyatt.com/">Martin</a> was playing in one of his groups. This kid wasn&#8217;t exactly overly confident and thus aggravating, but in contrast his coach on the sidelines was, choosing to clap every time his protégé got a point instead of Martin. He clapped insanely loudly. I was furious. In fact, I was so enraged that I decided to retaliate and clap when Martin got a point&#8230; but my clapping was muffled by my hay-fever induced tissue. Oops. It must have worked though because Martin won so NER NER NER NERRRR stupid arrogant coach man. Martin did really well throughout the tournament, especially in beating this guy who had a high rating very easily, and although he did have a &#8220;quick sulk" as he puts it, compared to the majority of tense players present at this competition (a trait which I had never witnessed in table tennis players before, usually calm and gentle souls), he remained positive and relatively stress-free. Compared to that stroppy pre-pubescent teenager he played at one point his disappointment was nothing, thank goodness I never have to be fourteen again is all I&#8217;m saying. Anyways, I&#8217;m proud so there<br/><br/>Et les lecteurs&#8230;<br/><br/>Desperate for a bit of valuable work experience, I recently contacted my local library to see if they could do anything for me, and their solution was to participate in therapeutic reading groups. My response: huhhh? Their response: come to the staff meeting, it might make a bit more sense. So I did. Today.<br/><br/>After this meeting, I was whisked away to Nelson to observe such an example of this innovation. I watched as a small group of elderly people were read a short story and a poem, and the way they engaged with it and conversed about memories gone by was pretty extraordinary. Although I usually feel uncomfortable all of the time, especially with this kind of thing, I felt quite sentimental for some reason during the whole time I was there. I think it&#8217;s because in the glistening eyes of the tender aged, I sometimes see my grandma</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3012329592241943967-6695054734217325354?l=clairepoof.blogspot.com" alt=""/></div>]]></content>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>Back home for the summer, finally.<br/><br/>It is insane though, how fast the past year has gone. I really didn&#8217;t expect it, but all of a sudden I&#8217;m back where I started, back in Burnley, back to trying to find a job and trying to read as much as I can whilst I have the time. I have no idea how I got here and how I survived, but all I&#8217;m hoping at the moment is that I really have survived, i.e. that I&#8217;ve passed my first year of university. I&#8217;ll get my results on Wednesday afternoon, but as I&#8217;m at home that means I&#8217;m going to have to ring my university and have a very awkward phone call. Mind you, it&#8217;s much better this way rather than being stuck in my lonely room on campus with nothing to do and missing family and friends and Martin too much. Staying there for another two weeks was completely pointless, and besides I can do so much more at home, even though I do still feel slightly useless here currently. And I&#8217;m starting to worry again about my inability to spend a long period in France this summer, unlike quite a few of the people on my course who will be working abroad and speaking French frequently&#8230; there&#8217;s not much I can do about it now but I&#8217;m just anxious that my French is going to be <em>terrible</em> when I return for my second year, something which I&#8217;m trying not to think about right not, even though I&#8217;m not as apprehensive as I was before. I think once I have my results and know where I stand, I will feel so much better.<br/><br/>However, I really am enjoying being back at home. Yesterday Martin and I went to Blackpool, because it&#8217;s been majorly hot here recently, and it felt great to just be able to relax and not worry about exams or revision or laundry or any of the other things which are daily concerns of my university life. Sometimes I worry that I should have been having the time of my life (as everyone seems to put it) at uni, but that cliche can&#8217;t apply to everyone, can it? Surely the fact that I&#8217;m getting a degree in order to have a better life in the future is enough? Though I can&#8217;t deny that towards the end of this academic year, I really started to settle in and actually began enjoying the whole experience&#8230; the fact is that I&#8217;m too sensitive and too much of a worrier and my anxieties often just get in the way of things. The fact is that I can&#8217;t really change that.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3012329592241943967-420512015378727784?l=clairepoof.blogspot.com" alt=""/></div>]]></content>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>Ahh the relief of finishing awful, awful exams. <br/><br/>Seriously, some of these exams I&#8217;ve had to do in my first year at university have been the absolute worse. I can&#8217;t remember struggling so much when I was doing my A Levels, though to be fair I did those exams at home where I felt more comfortable and less home-sick and friend-sick and Martin-sick, which inevitably adds to the wonders of exam stress.<br/><br/>But yesterday it all ended, culminating in a two hour exam in which I had to write 500 words of French about the pros and cons of euthanasia. Almost as delightful as my mock exam for this subject, where I had to consider whether paedophiles should be put to death (too easy was my conclusion in case you&#8217;re wondering for some strange reason). They sure do come up with some interesting topics for us to write about, I remember the good old days of A Level where we churned out essays about the environment, which was the most radical subject we ever considered.<br/><br/>It felt so strange when I put my pen down and left that exam hall yesterday. It still hasn&#8217;t sunk in that I&#8217;ve basically finished my first year of university and have somehow survived it all (in the hope that I won&#8217;t have to return early to do resits that is, fingers crossed please) and now I have a long, free summer to enjoy. It sounds really geeky but I&#8217;m looking forward to being able to read for fun again, though in all fairness I am doing an English degree so I&#8217;m allowed to be geeky about books and literature etc<br/><br/>So tomorrow I&#8217;m heading back to Burnley for the summer, I truly can&#8217;t wait. It&#8217;s funny how much you miss a place that once upon a time you thought you couldn&#8217;t wait to escape from. Though I suppose it&#8217;s the people I miss there and not the actual town in reality. Yet there&#8217;s something really comforting about the fact that this time tomorrow, I should be back home without any real worries. And so much to look forward to.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3012329592241943967-2751880076336114385?l=clairepoof.blogspot.com" alt=""/></div>]]></content>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>Seriously, I&#8217;m only a third of the way through my exams, and only two weeks away from hometime and summer, but I&#8217;m incredibly fed up. The problem is, now is the time when I&#8217;ve actually quite got into uni and I&#8217;m wanting to make plans, but everyone apart from me likes to revise in the evenings and at night and therefore people don&#8217;t really want to get out of their rooms at the moment. Which is what I&#8217;m becoming obsessed with. My room used to be a refuge from my routine of classes, in which I could get work done and then chill out afterwards. Now it&#8217;s become a claustrophobic prison where I&#8217;m constantly faced with the terrors of revision and boredom. Or l&#8217;ennui as Baudelaire aptly puts it<br/><br/>I&#8217;m actually dreading my next exam. 2 more weeks, just 2 more weeks<br/><br/>On a more positive note, me and Emily are hoping to organise a trip to France this summer, not only because I need to practise some French, but also because it&#8217;ll be nice to have a holiday with my best friend. We&#8217;re thinking Bordeaux, yet it&#8217;s very difficult to organise as of yet due to my being here, freaking out about exams, and her having finished her first year of uni and starting to enjoy summer. I know I started quite late here at Warwick (i.e. beginning of October) and we&#8217;ve had our fair share of holidays too, but I&#8217;m just so ready for summer to begin now, and seeing all of my friends finishing exams and things just makes me feel nauseatingly envious. <br/><br/>It&#8217;s surprising how tired you can get after not doing much all day apart from analysing poetry and revising French grammar, but mental exertion is the worst<br/><br/>I&#8217;m ready for shorts, sunnies, sangria, my back garden and a good book. And more picnics please, mine and Martin&#8217;s when I went home last week was wonderful, I hope the weather keeps up the good work</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3012329592241943967-8663036277675794960?l=clairepoof.blogspot.com" alt=""/></div>]]></content>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>Yes I&#8217;m rubbish at blogging, it&#8217;s official, unlike Martin who is using his lovely skills to redesign this for me, I have no idea what to do with it. His site is much better, <a href="http://www.mawyatt.com">see:</a><br/><br/>So I&#8217;m in the middle of exams, well a third of the way through to be exact. For some reason these exams have been much more stressful than any others I&#8217;ve experienced, and although my mum says I say this every year I know its especially true this year because it&#8217;s just so <em>strange</em> doing exams and revising so far away from home. It&#8217;s horrible to say that I feel lonely sometimes, but it&#8217;s true. I am growing up a lot though, at least I hope I am<br/><br/>2 more weeks or so<br/><br/>After my fairly successful Medieval to Renaissance Literature exam this morning (yes I don&#8217;t know why I&#8217;m studying English and French either), I think it&#8217;s safe to say that I&#8217;m getting into the swing of exams now, in fact this morning kind of felt like it was a year ago, when I was in the midst of A Levels and didn&#8217;t really care that after the summer I would have to move out and grow up. My next exam could possibly be horrific, as I&#8217;ve hated the module from the beginning, but I&#8217;ve decided, thanks to the help of my wondrous friends, family and petit ami, that it&#8217;s best to be positive, and most importantly merci mon petit ami for reminding me to breathe. That&#8217;s very important <br/><br/>So maybe I might make more of an effort with this now. It helps to vent after an exam, and even before it (as my bathroom-mate found out in the early hours of this morning as she heard me screaming in frustration due to lack of sleep), and writing like this definitely helps. I also have another aim for this blog, inspired once again by the petit ami, and that is to focus on something with it. I&#8217;ll probably use it to chart my final weeks of year one of university, and then my adventures in the summer, and possibly might get even more adventurous and actually just write and review things. After all, I did once harbour dreams of being a music or fashion journalist, it&#8217;s just that everything has been so scary as of late. This is no excuse, I&#8217;m going to write, if only for my benefit. And although I&#8217;ll look back on this in a couple of weeks and despair and sigh, right now I want to make an effort, with everything. I&#8217;m trying harder with everything more than I ever have in my life.<br/><br/>Okay rant over. I cannot wait until these exams are over and I can enjoy summer again, last summer seems like an age ago. When did everything change?</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3012329592241943967-1738398040680834282?l=clairepoof.blogspot.com" alt=""/></div>]]></content>

    <description></description>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Yes, I fail at blogging. To be honest, I&#8217;m too busy trying to read the Faerie Queene and trying to remember why I picked English and French to study at university. I honestly do not remember ever picking this degree, I guess I just fell into it.<br/><br/>But seeing as I&#8217;m here now, I might as well give it a good try.<br/><br/>So reading week was amazing thanks. Actually managed to do some work, despite Valentines Mexican with Martin, then watching him become some sort of local table tennis champion (I wish I could understand sport.), then watching him play more table tennis, then going to the opticians, then getting new glasses, then having a 24marathon with my cousin Beckyy, then going to Preston with lovelyy Martin, then coming back to Warwick yesterday. No I don&#8217;t know how I did any work either.<br/><br/>But to be fair, thinking about it, last term I had no free weekends and still managed to get ahead with work. I guess me being a freak when it comes to getting work done in time is quite good, especially when you want to avoid stress and have time to see your boyfriend. So I should never complain about work. But I still will.<br/><br/>4 weeks until Easter holidays. Gosh this year has gone so fast, I don&#8217;t even know where I am anymore</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3012329592241943967-3105746195818456050?l=clairepoof.blogspot.com" alt=""/></div>]]></content>

    <title>vingt-six: l'université.</title>
    <description></description>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Wow I am really bad at blogging.<br/>My room at university looks out onto this pond/lake thing, the ducks and geese wake me up all the time with these incessant quacking/squawking sounds. Irritating much.<br/><br/>I never expected to miss Burnley, but then again I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s Burnley I miss. I miss my family, my friends, and definitely Mr Wyatt. He&#8217;s too lovely<br/><br/>English and French is a hard degree. There&#8217;s lots of poetry involved, wonderful. I do like Baudelaire though. <br/><br/>Anyways, so next week involves:<br/><br/>Monday - obligatory make a fool of myself day in my French Oral Class then sleep forever<br/><br/>Tuesday - one lecture day where I attempt to do all of my work, lovelyy. Free film night with casino games, drinks and quizzes, thank you Warwick Student Cinema.<br/><br/>Wednesday - one seminar day where I again try to do work. Flat meal, we&#8217;re actually going to cook something good and wholesome. Of course I was on buying wine and chocolate cake duties<br/><br/>Thursday - I hate Thursdays. They&#8217;re always rubbish. Howl&#8217;s Moving Castle is on at the SU cinema though, this will cheer me up<br/><br/>Friday - horrible day with horrible classes. This will be packing day, as on Saturday I&#8217;m coming home for reading week, ohhyess. <br/><br/>I might actually make an attempt to update this now, wouldn&#8217;t that be fun.<br/><br/>P.S. I got twitter. HA</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3012329592241943967-3233421884419732164?l=clairepoof.blogspot.com" alt=""/></div>]]></content>

Or things get in the way. This has been neglected because of all of the above.<br/><br/>The last time I wrote was about a week before I turned 18. That seems like an age ago, probably because it was. Since then I&#8217;ve danced, sang, read, grown up, felt younger than ever, gone on adventures, loved, shopped, gushed, been terrified, been rejected, failed, succeeded, worried, drank and drank, worked and worked, written pages and pages, read plenty more pages and pages, worried some more, passed my driving test, listened, been listened to, seen some sights, taken pictures, had pictures taken of me, cried, laughed, embarrassed myself and slept. <br/><br/>The pile of books by the side of my bed has decreased at least. Even though I keep adding to it, just as I keep adding to my iTunes library. Though I do think that Spotify is pure genius, in all honesty. <br/><br/>I&#8217;m usually so good at committing myself to things.<br/><br/>Yet here I am, trying to summarise the last few months in a couple of paragraphs, again because I&#8217;m lacking in time. All the time, I have no time. I guess that&#8217;s quite normal, though.<br/><br/>How naive is too naive</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3012329592241943967-8326350670094054397?l=clairepoof.blogspot.com" alt=""/></div>]]></content>

    <description></description>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been too busy to write anything. This is sad.<br/><br/>But it&#8217;s also really good I suppose. Despite all the work I&#8217;ve had to do lately, I&#8217;ve been off out to Warwick [uni, we got incomprehensibly lost in Birmingham on the way], gigs and parties and the like. My UCAs has been sent off, which is a little bit scary if I&#8217;m honest. Also scary is my upcoming driving test, the date of which I&#8217;m telling absolutely no one, except that I tell people that its soon. Whether I&#8217;ll pass or not is another question entirely, I doubt it but I&#8217;m not too bothered either way.<br/><br/>Things are pretty good though.<br/><br/>I must make a note to go out with Paddy some time, his nights out sound boss. I just found out that &#8220;boss" is an expression from Liverpool which is a bit weird. I&#8217;ve moved on from one obsession to another lately, this happens every once in a while.<br/><br/>My driving instructor reckons that I&#8217;m an oddball, but quite brilliant. I guess that&#8217;s true, if not it&#8217;s the best description of me that I&#8217;ve heard so far.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3012329592241943967-2447037898916364111?l=clairepoof.blogspot.com" alt=""/></div>]]></content>

To Hellbound, ohhyes. Great night, even though we didn&#8217;t stay long because of my [awful] driving this morning, but at least we know now that its good and everything. Might be fun convincing Jess of this though like.<br/><br/>My History teacher either loves me or hates me, I haven&#8217;t decided. <br/><br/>We&#8217;re all having to be ridiculously organised at college at the moment; UCAS and stuff has to be sorted out pretty quickly, especially for me and Jess for Oxford and for Em with medicine. I&#8217;ve rewritten my personal statement about a million times and I have a reading list that&#8217;s immense, ohhdear.<br/><br/>Making more plans to go out though now.<br/><br/>I love listening to the Donnie Darko soundtrack, someone dressed up as Frank on the college walk thing, impressive much</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3012329592241943967-1020476913719497551?l=clairepoof.blogspot.com" alt=""/></div>]]></content>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>The 5th day of September and my first Friday back at college.<br/><br/>Form is good, at least I see catcat there, because English language is quite bad without her and the teacher I had last year. My form teacher is a bit bizarre though like.<br/><br/>English lit is good, obviously. Ha.<br/><br/>History is bad/good. I haven&#8217;t decided yet. hmm. All I know is that it&#8217;s ridiculous, teacher-wise. It has potential to be a good class though, at least I have Jess though.<br/><br/>French is also good, bien sûr.<br/><br/>Helen smuggled into my classics class on our first day back, because she&#8217;s in the other one, so we&#8217;re both alone now, which is incredibly ridiculous.<br/><br/>Whoever decided to split me and Helen up obviously was the same person who thought that purple and yellow go together and fixed tables and chairs in the canteen is a good idea.<br/><br/>Paddy keeps making me laugh on our coach. The journey to Blackburn and back has never gone so fast. I&#8217;m going to teach him to speak French, bit by bit.<br/><br/>Short weeks are always good.<br/><br/>BUT<br/>asif I have to dress up as a rat for my form! I mean we all do but still. I know the whole walk in the park is for a good cause, but there are some ridiculous people coming up with these ideas. They need a slap.<br/><br/>I bought Elle today, which only depressed me because I have no money and I want too many things. Gutted. At least college isn&#8217;t too bad. I like fresh starts.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3012329592241943967-3364523800934415185?l=clairepoof.blogspot.com" alt=""/></div>]]></content>

    <description></description>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>I remember meeting this nice girl at Oxford and telling her that I devour literature. This could be the corniest thing that I have ever said, but not only did she think that it was a great metaphor, my capacity for &#8220;devouring literature" [ohhh dear God] has ameliorated immensely as of late. <br/><br/>I&#8217;m not sure if ameliorate is the right verb, but it sure sounds good.<br/><br/>Anyway, I&#8217;ve been taking full advantage of Waterstone&#8217;s 3 for 2 deal on books, especially as you can buy those Penguin classics printed on recycled paper for £2. This means that I paid £8 for six great books. <br/><br/>Cheeky bonus.<br/><br/>So, after finishing <em>Wicked</em>, then Chuck Palahniuk&#8217;s new one [which was good, hurrah!], I moved onto <em>The Great Gatsby</em> [amazingg] and now I am about to tackle Dostoyevsky. Scary or what.<br/><br/>Aside from the ridiculous amount of reading I&#8217;ve been doing, I&#8217;ve been fair ill, buying tights and bags and skirts in an also ridiculous fashion and been listening to music a hell of a lot. Been going out with friends of course, and when Jess returns from Dubai [where my glasses steamed up when I stepped off a plane and into that country] we shall be making plans to go out and dance and drink and things. Though I don&#8217;t think Jess does much dancing. We shall see.<br/><br/>Back to college next week, which is quite good. I miss some people.<br/><br/>The weather is supposed to improve this week, but things never turn out just the way you plan.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3012329592241943967-4687661425953990603?l=clairepoof.blogspot.com" alt=""/></div>]]></content>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>I don&#8217;t half make a fuss out of nothing.<br/><br/>So yesterday was results day, and us A/S lot had to go in the afternoon. I guess I go to quite a big college. This meant that I kept on seeing and talking to people who presumed that I already had my results, but I didn&#8217;t, which made me feel sicker and sicker. God knows why, results aren&#8217;t everything, and I haven&#8217;t even done full A levels yet. <br/><br/>I got five As though, cheeky bonus. <br/><br/>Hopefully the Oxford dream might become a reality then. I always feel really weird telling people which university I want to go to, because usually their reaction is &#8220;ohhhreallyy?" or &#8220;eughhh, they&#8217;re all posh there love" or something to that effect. Which is quite ridiculous to be fair, and that clause sounds more pretentious in type than it did in my head. All I know is that Oxford is where I want to be in a year&#8217;s time. <br/><br/>I think people expected it of me, to be honest, I&#8217;m getting tired of this. Fussy.<br/><br/>It was nice to see people at college though. I go back properly in a few weeks, hopefully it should be all good. Last year though, which is weird, it feels like we&#8217;ve only just started. They&#8217;ll be making a fuss when we get back and all, seeing as university applications and things need to be in fairly soon.<br/><br/>Plans for tomorrow, I want this new skirt and my parents gave me &#8220;well done" money, and we might be going to the cinema. It&#8217;s all good :] Summer made a brief cameo today, only to be drowned out by the rain. Of course.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3012329592241943967-2337021018202810113?l=clairepoof.blogspot.com" alt=""/></div>]]></content>

Everyone says I&#8217;ll be fine, which is all very nice but not very helpful because I&#8217;m not exactly perfect. Although I need really, really good grades I know better than to expect them just because I&#8217;m quite good academically. <br/><br/>ANYWAY<br/><br/>Trying not to think about the future. Yesterday I went into town with Jess, cue pointing out anything with leopard print [she loves it], praising the £1 Topshop jewellery sale and being impressed by her driving skills. She is a very good driver, even though the reverse gear on her gearstick doesn&#8217;t work that well sometimes. So we had a good day anyways.<br/><br/>Last weekend I decided to text Emily in France. I said, &#8220;I&#8217;M IN A HOTEL IN LEEDS, LOL". Seemed quite funny at the time. <br/><br/>But I actually was in a hotel in Leeds, funnily enough.<br/><br/>Every year, this guy called Chris who my dad works with invites us over to Ilkley, near Leeds, where he lives, and we have a meal together and usually stay over in a nice hotel. So that&#8217;s what we did, but we stayed at this hotel in Leeds instead of one in Ilkley. The meal was fair nice, and we drank some strong red red wine. It was very strong. The Wi-Fi in the hotel was pretty impressive too. The constant rain wasn&#8217;t. Apparently we&#8217;re not getting a summer now, gutted. I guessed as much. <br/><br/>Anyway, I&#8217;m also waiting for Emily to return, as I owe her money for Foals [eekk! so excited about that]. Funnily enough, Red Socks Pugie just came on, thanks shuffle. I&#8217;m waiting with anticipation to see Foals, so I&#8217;m going to go and watch the episode of Never Mind the Buzzcocks with Yannis on [he&#8217;s the frontman.] Ohhhyes.<br/><br/>I&#8217;m also sort of waiting to go back to college. There&#8217;s nothing on the job front and I miss people. I also have lots of new clothes, and last year I ended up not repeating outfits for the whole college year. This is a quite sad achievement, it used to sound so impressive. <br/><br/>I hope that all this waiting is worth it.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3012329592241943967-7603775927790566352?l=clairepoof.blogspot.com" alt=""/></div>]]></content>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>Hello, August.<br/><br/>This year is going incomprehensibly fast, so I don&#8217;t really blame my mum for wanting to be organised about my 18th. I certainly don&#8217;t blame college for wanting us to get sorted about universities as soon as we get back. Though it does scare me more than a little bit.<br/><br/>Anyway, my mum asked me to look at balloons for my party today, and I&#8217;ve seen some nice arrangements if you will. Some of them are quite expensive though.<br/><br/>Speaking of balloons, Emily has booked the tickets to see Foals in October! I&#8217;m so excited, I really really love Foals. They are lovely. When she comes back from France next week I&#8217;ll pay her for my ticket; shall miss her though.<br/><br/>As Emily leaves for France, Jess should be returning from Majorca [I think?] this week I reckon. Emily comes back on results day, which is coming around wayy too fast. Not excited about that day at all, but only because of the dread that comes with exam results of course.<br/><br/>I am excited, however, about autumn and winter of this year. I know, summer has barely even started and I doubt that it will, but October through to December this year is going to be boss. Foals, then McFly, then my birthday, then my party, then Boosh live, then Kings of Leonnnn and then Christmas and the usual. Good times :]<br/><br/>No work yet though. I&#8217;m starting to give up on Jobsearch, not that it&#8217;s their fault like. I blame the economy. But I&#8217;m disappointed in myself for not being able to find any work at all. I need the money really. <br/><br/>I need to be more confident with my driving. Maybe I should try and be excited about my lessons instead of the opposite.<br/><br/>I&#8217;m reading <em>the Iliad</em>, it&#8217;s pretty good. However, having studied <em>The Odyssey</em> in Classics at college, I keep finding myself mentally cheering for Odysseus whenever he pops up. Quite funny really.<br/><br/>I really like CSI Las Vegas, I keep watching it lately.<br/><br/>It&#8217;s still raining.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3012329592241943967-7775521266572855796?l=clairepoof.blogspot.com" alt=""/></div>]]></content>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>I used to feel scared, but now I just feel nothing.<br/><br/>I&#8217;m quite surprised at myself. After watching <em>Fight Club</em> the other day my brain was in Chuck Palahniuk mode, i.e. I was coming up with witty bitter one-liners, and surprisingly I didn&#8217;t blog any of them. Probably because they were rubbish. Go figure. <br/><br/>But anyway, I hadn&#8217;t seen the film before. I&#8217;d read the book obviously. I don&#8217;t know, it&#8217;s quite confusing, especially the very veryy last bit, but it&#8217;s still good somehow. But <em>Invisible Monsters</em> will be my favourite, forever and ever. I wish I could write a book that brilliant. <br/><br/>I&#8217;m going to go and play my guitar. I feel motivated, which is quite good, but I still need a job and I still want to go back to college, even though it means I&#8217;ll have to face my results.<br/><br/>It&#8217;s funny, accomplishments are supposed to make you happy, but they just make me feel relieved.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3012329592241943967-2534934213621914269?l=clairepoof.blogspot.com" alt=""/></div>]]></content>

    <description></description>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>I just cleaned the bath with a cloth, some Cillit Bang and a bit of charm. Job well done.<br/><br/>There&#8217;s a big cloud hanging over my house, and it&#8217;s not metaphorical in the slightest. Yesterday was like the weekend, i.e. really sunny and reallyy warm, so I sat outside with my book. Which reminds me, I finished that volume of Daphne du Mari er, ending with <em>Frenchman&#8217;s Creek</em> [eughhh] and <em>My Cousin Rachel </em>[pretty good]. Now I&#8217;m reading that parody of Harry Potter, you know, Barry Trotter. It&#8217;s quite funny actually, but completely stupid and ridiculous. Luckily I&#8217;ve just ordered <em>the Iliad </em>and <em>Wicked</em> [it was a book originally y&#8217;see] from play.com to counter this stupidity. <br/><br/>But anyway, for once in my life I&#8217;ve been quite enjoying sitting out in the sun, and now I can&#8217;t. Hopefully the cloud will have disappeared by the time I&#8217;ve finished this, because otherwise I&#8217;ll just have to watch another episode of Skins. Ohhdear.<br/><br/>To be fair, it was supposed to rain all day today, and not just last night, so it&#8217;s not too bad. I just hope that the weather stays nice for a bit longer, as I might be off out and about this week.<br/><br/>Results in just over two weeks. I remember having more nightmares about my GCSEs but feeling less sick than I do about my A/Ss. They really count if I really want to go to Oxford. Which I do.<br/><br/>People just assume that I&#8217;ll be fine.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3012329592241943967-2744635831130274325?l=clairepoof.blogspot.com" alt=""/></div>]]></content>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve seen enough of the Lancashire coastline to last me a lifetime.<br/><br/>Last weekend, it was Blackpool. Yesterday, St Annes, which was a lot less boring than I anticipated. Today, we went to Southport, which was very nice and plus I got a really nice skirt from Primark of all places. <br/><br/>The sun has finally come out, at last.<br/><br/>The other night I watched American Gangster, which is truly a great film. Last night I watched Clueless, which is also truly a great film. I&#8217;ve seen it about 2839652937485632 times, and it never gets old. Never.<br/><br/>I love Last Choir Standing, to be honest. The one from Oxford who sang Spiderman last night were absolutely genius.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3012329592241943967-3576849719275144977?l=clairepoof.blogspot.com" alt=""/></div>]]></content>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>Heath Ledger was absolutely magnificent.<br/><br/>It is simply wrong that he&#8217;s gone. Batman was great, but not because of Batman. It was because of the Joker, who was scary yet strangely alluring all at once.<br/><br/>Highlight of the film? The Joker asked the real Batman to stand up [I actually just typed barman, haha], and some guy in the cinema actually did. Ohh my days, we found Batman at last, and no, it isn&#8217;t Bruce Wayne. Amateur. <br/><br/>Afterwards, we went back to Aaron&#8217;s, crossing Deathville a.k.a. the really really scary part of Burnley, near where Emily&#8217;s dad works. I don&#8217;t even know where it is really, I just followed and whimpered.<br/><br/>I&#8217;ve had three people tell me now that there&#8217;s a job going at Oddies. To be honest, I&#8217;m still hoping for just some temp work, and hopefully I&#8217;ll get some soon from good old Jobsearch. <br/><br/>Emily&#8217;s dad has a swish car, but it does nothing for my hair.<br/><br/>Today I&#8217;m going driving, he said we&#8217;re going to do a mock test. I do not want to do a mock test, I really really don&#8217;t. I&#8217;m trying to forget about doing my practical, even though I had hopes of passing it before I go back to college. I have until September, so I think I have a good chance I suppose. But I like to not think about the things I&#8217;m scared about. Or the things that I can&#8217;t change.<br/><br/>Sometimes I wish I could change most things.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3012329592241943967-3818465907756717197?l=clairepoof.blogspot.com" alt=""/></div>]]></content>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>I now have pretty much the entire Hairspray soundtrack.<br/><br/>I&#8217;m sorry, but it&#8217;s just absolutely amazing. John Travolta&#8217;s voice ain&#8217;t half weird though, I suppose it&#8217;s because he&#8217;s trying to sing like a woman. Just guessing. <br/><br/>Today I watched the very first two episodes of SATC. Now that was weird. Carrie kept on talking directly to the camera, which made me feel more than just a little bit uncomfortable. I did my best to just eat my noodles whenever she did that. <br/><br/>My dad just thought I was singing Good Morning Pokemon. BALTIMORE JEEZZ<br/><br/>Anyway, speaking of Hairspray, I&#8217;m developing something for Zac Efron. I blame Aaron. At my cinema, they now have a big cut out of the cast of High School Musical 3 to match the poster that we all posed next to. It&#8217;s pretty impressive, unlike our obsession. But I am fair excited for this film, I&#8217;ve seen the trailer, and so has my dad, and we both think it&#8217;s hilarious. It looks like the funniest yet. Because that&#8217;s the only reason why I watch these films&#8230;<br/><br/>I&#8217;m not as cool as I make out, obviously.<br/><br/>Though I try. Instead of watching Hannah Montana re-runs, I decided I&#8217;m going to watch Skins series 2 again, and I also found Sugar Rush on TV Choice on Demand, one of the only perks of having Virgin Media. Thanks Mr Branson for taking my Sky One away, by the way. It&#8217;s quite good, but just a little bit uncomfortable.<br/><br/>I reallyy like the new last.fm. They have my entire library ready for me to listen to, which means that I can practically listen to my entire iTunes library [and anything else I&#8217;ve ever listened to] on my laptop. This is very handy indeed. <br/><br/>Tilly and the Wall are fabulous.<br/><br/>I had a good guitar lesson today, even if I looked like a cartoon character. That damn C chord is still fair annoying though.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3012329592241943967-7353259276352080413?l=clairepoof.blogspot.com" alt=""/></div>]]></content>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>I was visited by Jess today.<br/><br/>She came to drop Emily&#8217;s present off, seeing as she probably won&#8217;t be seeing her until she comes back from her holiday. And she can&#8217;t come and see The Dark Knight [sighh, Heath!] with us on Thursday due to work and weddings and things.<br/><br/>Anyway, we talked for about an hour before she drove off back home just to check that her little sister hadn&#8217;t burnt the house down or something. Fair enough I thought, and went back to watching the SATC movie for the second time. <br/><br/>Yesterday the parents and I went to Blackpool.<br/><br/>The weather is getting increasingly nicer, but in Blackpool it was incredibly windy. I had foolishly decided to wear a skirt [though with tights, because it wasn&#8217;t that warm though it was sunny]. I had a lot of fun [!] trying to make sure that my skirt stayed exactly where I wanted it to stay. I.e. on my legs and not in the air.<br/><br/>The new jacket I got from the Monsoon sale is to die for. Well, maybe that is a bit extreme, but it is lovely lovely lovelyy.<br/><br/>I have just been for a walk on the canal with the parents. They would never let me walk on there alone, even though I&#8217;d like to, during the free time I have during the days. Jess understands this, and I guess I do too, because there are some scary people around here and there are even more scary people around the canal. <br/><br/>I never thought I would suit red, being ginger and all, but I fair do. Bonus.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3012329592241943967-9221889381646960742?l=clairepoof.blogspot.com" alt=""/></div>]]></content>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today is Emily&#8217;s 17th birthday. I bought her perfume [clue: Use With Caution] and a mug from Urban Outfitters that says &#8220;Tea Club" and tells you all the rules of this club.<br/><br/>1. The first rule about tea club is that you don&#8217;t talk about tea club.<br/>2. The second rule about tea club is that you don&#8217;t talk about tea club.<br/><br/>And so on.<br/><br/>Chuck Palahniuk is an absolute genius.<br/><br/>Anyways, tonight we are going to see Mamma Mia and I want to wear my new dress.<br/><br/>Yesterday morning I drove to Preston and back with my driving instructor, and I passed my theory test. I got full marks on my questions, bonus. Even though I didn&#8217;t really know how you should park facing downhill. Shoot me.<br/><br/>As a treat, we went to Manchester, i.e. me and the parents, partly to buy Emily&#8217;s present for today. Partly because the sales are pretty good this summer [ha!]. I bought a skirt and some shorts from Urban Outfitters, aside from the mug.<br/><br/>Oh and I fair pulled the shop assistant ;]<br/><br/>Haha. Probably not really, but he was very nice and my mum observed so from the next counter. It&#8217;s nice when things like that happen.<br/><br/>Anyway, speaking of birthdays, my mum is constantly urging me to think about my party [by the way, it&#8217;s in November. No joke.] and today we bought dad his present for next month. We&#8217;ve been saving for a tv for him, and then we realised that we know nothing about tvs whatsoever, so we decided to reveal the surprise. He was very excited, even more so now he&#8217;s got one, and he even dreamt about tvs last night. Me, I dreamt about the Kaiser Chiefs and the end of the world. Something similar happened before.<br/><br/>Today in Sainsburys a woman dropped a big box of Becks bottles and they all smashed on the floor.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3012329592241943967-3239378371442524938?l=clairepoof.blogspot.com" alt=""/></div>]]></content>

We were stuck near Milton Keynes for about two hours, and the light was slowly getting dimmer and dimmer. However, we did find ways to entertain ourselves. After all, they did give us glowsticks. And the announcer, aka the self-professed &#8220;train man" couldn&#8217;t speak English very well. He kept saying that Virgin would like to thank each and every individual for their immense patience and that we would eventually reach our final destiny. No joke.<br/><br/>I couldn&#8217;t even listen to Nick Grimshaw on the radio talking about the fruit in McFly&#8217;s dressing room. Gutted. <br/><br/>We don&#8217;t know where Rugby is, but imagine what their rugby and football teams are called.<br/><br/>Anyway, after our fears of there snakes on our train being dispelled, we were finally in London and at the YCW house. We went as a Catholic youth group, y&#8217;see. And we went to bed.<br/><br/><a href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_0kq6uagL8nY/SH-C9qXlVXI/AAAAAAAAABI/30X9FY6N2Yo/s1600-h/IMGP0099.JPG"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_0kq6uagL8nY/SH-C9qXlVXI/AAAAAAAAABI/30X9FY6N2Yo/s320/IMGP0099.JPG" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5224038088629900658"/></a>The next morning, a lovely Monday morning, we went on a clipper boat across the Thames. Then we decided to brave an open top bus across London, where we saw pretty much everything there is to see in London. You name it, we probably saw it. It was good fun though. Father Brian was desperate to go to the National Art Gallery, so we went and had a look. They had Claude Monet and Van Gogh dolls, complete with removable ear. Wow.<br/><br/>After freshening up a bit, because it was really really hot, we had a very rushed tea in a pub on the Wharf, and then ran to the West End to see Hairspray.<br/><br/>I still have You Can&#8217;t Stop The Beat in my head.<br/><br/>It was boss, and we were all in great moods. Shattered like, with half of us getting sunburnt as well. So sleep wasn&#8217;t a problem.<br/><br/><a href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_0kq6uagL8nY/SH-E3GzpDEI/AAAAAAAAABQ/0zBTSFhWrXE/s1600-h/IMGP0144.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_0kq6uagL8nY/SH-E3GzpDEI/AAAAAAAAABQ/0zBTSFhWrXE/s320/IMGP0144.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5224040175027948610"/></a>On the Tuesday, we decided to go to the Tate Modern, which was great. I really like Pop Art, and Lichtenstein was there. Well, not in person, but some of his art was on display. The Street Art murals were pretty ace too actually. We pretended to be holy outside of St Pauls, and I got excited about the Globe because Shakespeare WOZ ERE 1599 BBZ living it up to the max and such. <br/><br/>It was off to see Wicked at night, after having some pizza at Bella Italia. Wicked was also boss, I could have bought a t-shirt but I thought £19 was a tad extortionate. Ahh well. <a href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_0kq6uagL8nY/SH-GX-JMoAI/AAAAAAAAABY/_neCDdgVy04/s1600-h/IMGP0165.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_0kq6uagL8nY/SH-GX-JMoAI/AAAAAAAAABY/_neCDdgVy04/s320/IMGP0165.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5224041839149752322"/></a><br/><br/>On Wednesday, we went shopping OHHYES. I had a heart attack when I saw Topshop, because it is HUUUGE. I was so impressed with the vintage section, I could have gone ballistic but I didn&#8217;t. I got a really nice dress though. Then Emily, Becca and myself went to Abercrombie and Fitch, and it took us ages to find it. Quite worth it though, seeing as all of the shop assistants were incredibly attractive and some were half-naked. Then we raced to Primark and got lost in people traffic. <br/><br/>The journey home was slightly more interesting as we had to manoeuvre our luggage on the Tube. Very hard indeed. But once we were on the train home, things went pretty smoothly and we were home quite early.<br/><br/>I slept until 12.30 today, surprised?</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3012329592241943967-2961141132247563143?l=clairepoof.blogspot.com" alt=""/></div>]]></content>

We had a good day though to be fair, despite having to run into Boots to escape them. They were pretty scary with those sweets.<br/><br/>The above photo of Emily, Aaron, Sarah and myself took about 21387184546 attempts to get it right. <br/><br/>I decided to brave Topshop, and it wasn&#8217;t as bad as I had feared. I bet the sale is 143757567 times better down in London, yess we are going tomorrow! I actually can&#8217;t wait now. Plus, we&#8217;re not getting into London as late as we though, so we won&#8217;t be that tired hopefully.<br/><br/>We tried on High School Musical hats. I have the worst fringe gaps in the world.<a href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_0kq6uagL8nY/SHjhC8Cwl3I/AAAAAAAAAAw/dW6Pm4SIGrA/s1600-h/IMGP0069.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_0kq6uagL8nY/SHjhC8Cwl3I/AAAAAAAAAAw/dW6Pm4SIGrA/s320/IMGP0069.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5222171208529778546"/></a> <br/><br/>All in all, we had a good day :] Aaron did well with all his DVDs and his jeans which he tried on in the Subway [the sandwich shop] toilets. We thought he was locked in or something. I got a Crunchie from nowhere, and Michael was working hard of course.<br/><br/>I always worry about getting in people&#8217;s way.<br/><br/>Tonight Ghostbusters is on, ohhyess! It serves my parents right for not buying it on DVD for me [to be fair, it was only a couple of quid.], because now they have to watch it to prove that it is always on TV. Ha.<br/><br/><br/><a href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_0kq6uagL8nY/SHjjEhhZIVI/AAAAAAAAAA4/m2zq4TA07oo/s1600-h/IMGP0071.JPG"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_0kq6uagL8nY/SHjjEhhZIVI/AAAAAAAAAA4/m2zq4TA07oo/s320/IMGP0071.JPG" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5222173434793501010"/></a> EPIC FAIL<br/>Haha.<br/>I wonder what will happen to this car. It might be punished I suppose. Serves it right for disobeying the painted warning. Aaron and Emilyy look so shocked, well actually they look quite puzzled. I looked like a fool taking this picture. Worth it I suppose.<br/><br/>London babyy!

    <content><![CDATA[<p>My driving instructor nearly forgot me again today. Maybe I&#8217;m just forgettable.<br/><br/>Enough with the negativity. I can drive well enough, and park and reverse around corners and do turns in the road. I like those the best. And I will pass my test before I get back to college in September, just so I can say that I can drive and even plug my &#8220;driving skillzz" to prospective universities. It might work. I won&#8217;t even have a car to drive, BUT if I did, I could drive it. If I wanted to.<br/><br/><em>Frenchman&#8217;s Creek</em> is boring, boring, boring. But I&#8217;m still going to read it.<br/>Driving, for me, is hard, hard, hard. But I&#8217;m still going to drive.<br/><br/>Both reading and driving will get easier if I just keep at it.<br/><br/>I will have to ring Emily. She hasn&#8217;t called me yet. Hopefully we will all meet up tomorrow, and I can roadtest my new camera. I need some new lovely pictures of us all.<br/><br/>Another frustrating thing, however, is that I really want to go to the <a href="http://www.meandyu.com">Me&amp;Yu</a> sale, even more than I want to go to the Topshop sale, but I can&#8217;t, one because it&#8217;s in Manchester and two because I need to save, save, save for London on [eek!] Sunday. At least they have a HUUUUGE Topshop in London to keep me happy. Though it&#8217;s vintage bargains I will be seeking in our capital city. I have, however, seen the most amazing bag in the world in Toppers; I saw it last night on the magnificent Gok Wan&#8217;s show. It&#8217;s a big red heart, and I refuse to forget it.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3012329592241943967-6990428393908148081?l=clairepoof.blogspot.com" alt=""/></div>]]></content>

    <content><![CDATA[<a href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_0kq6uagL8nY/SHTL9uLyq-I/AAAAAAAAAAY/265rkE6WBQA/s1600-h/2.jpg"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5221022129259195362" style="FLOAT: left; MARGIN: 0px 10px 10px 0px; WIDTH: 280px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 207px" height="229" alt="" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_0kq6uagL8nY/SHTL9uLyq-I/AAAAAAAAAAY/265rkE6WBQA/s320/2.jpg" width="301" border="0"/></a><br/>You&#8217;ll never believe it.<br/><br/><br/>I received another pre-recorded message phone call today. Luckily I was downstairs this time. I picked up the receiver, only to hear a deafening klaxon on the other end.<br/><br/><br/>"Hello, this is The Captain," the pre-recorded false voice said to me. I could hear the sea in the background. Ohh no.<br/><br/><br/>I didn&#8217;t even bother to wait to find out what I&#8217;d won this time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The waves of the ocean I could hear behind &#8220;The Captain&#8220;&#8216;s voice sounded quite threatening actually. It reminded me of the chapter I&#8217;ve just read in Daphne du Marier&#8217;s <em>Rebecca</em>. I saw the plot twist coming, but it was still surprising. The main character, not Rebecca incidentally, reminds me of myself - shy and insecure. Great.<br/><br/><br/>When I heard the knock on my door this afternoon, I was actually upstairs. Behind my front door was a man who is doing some work for my next door neighbour, and he needed to measure some wall at the back of our houses. He kept referring to my neighbour as &#8220;The Shopfitter", which was a bit strange. I didn&#8217;t have a clue what he was talking about the whole time he was here.<br/><br/><br/>I am no good at painting my nails whatsoever.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The weather looked a bit more promising this morning for a full hour, before the sun disappeared completely behind the greedy clouds. Completely unfair. By four o&#8217;clock it&#8217;s raining, again. It&#8217;s supposed to be good in London next week at least, and I did get a high score on the signs and signals theory test quiz. Bonus. Hazard perception is completely pointless, mind.<br/><br/><br/><br/>I love finding new good music. And really old music, just remixed.<br/><p>That photo above is a familar scenario with my best friend, Emilyy. The one who isn&#8217;t covering her face in shame. That would be me. I do that a lot. She smiles a lot. I&#8217;m glad that she&#8217;s possibly one of the only people in the world I can really talk to. Plus, we have Hannah Montana necklaces. Except that she lost hers, perhaps she should be the one covering her face in shame. Ha. She rang me today, my Dizzee Rascal ringtone screaming out at me from nowhere [ohhyes, I am this cool]. Hopefully she, Michael, Aaron and myself will be meeting up on Saturday, which is good yess :] </p><p>This week, I will make more plans. I need to.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3012329592241943967-7074171133356645427?l=clairepoof.blogspot.com" alt=""/></div>]]></content>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>This afternoon, the phone rang whilst I was upstairs. Que a mad scramble to get to the phone in time. I&#8217;m surprised I&#8217;m not in the emergency room by now, given the number of times I have had to do this over the past few weeks.<br/>I got to the phone, and it was one of those rubbish pre-recorded messages. Apparently I&#8217;ve won a free holiday or something. Bonus.<br/>Gutted, more like. I nearly died trying to get that phone call, and there was no point whatsoever.<br/>Much like today really. Mind you, last night&#8217;s Sex and The City episodes were good, though today&#8217;s Cornish pasty wasn&#8217;t. Gutted once again.<br/><br/>Speaking of being gutted, it looks like there&#8217;s no chance whatsoever of me earning some extra money in time for London next week [eek! excited]. Yesterday, my mum was at this fashion show [don&#8217;t even ask. I was not impressed i.e. I was highly jealous] and her friend knows someone who works at JobSearch, where I applied for some temp. work. Apparently there is absolutely no work going whatsoever. GUTTED. Ahh well, at least I have my boss new camera, that&#8217;s a plus.<br/><br/>Today I went from being inexplicably jealous of someone to having pity for that same person in about three seconds.<br/><br/>At half past five every Tuesday I have my guitar lesson with my teacher Paul. He&#8217;s ace. I started playing bass guitar a while back, but when I realised just how easy that was I decided to start playing acoustic. My acoustic guitar is beautiful, it&#8217;s all white and everything. I&#8217;m not that good at it though, to be honest. Gutted.<br/><br/>I wish I could write and sing songs like Backseat Goodbye. He is magnificent.<br/><br/>At the moment, the C chord is the worst chord in the world. Most of the time when I play it, it comes out all whiney and it hurts my ears. Much worse, however, were the scary ghost videos Paul decided to show me. They look so false but the weird ghosts come out of nowhere, especially after the panpipe music. I think I screamed; ohh dear.<br/><br/>Y&#8217;know, if I can&#8217;t get a job, I should at least find something more productive to do with my time, instead of just reading, watching tv and revising driving theory.<br/><br/>I think I need to get out of the house, but the weather is so disconcerting. It looks like it won&#8217;t pick up for quite some time. Gutted, again.<br/><br/>Finally, note to self: when practising hazard perception for your theory test, if it asks you to look out for the horse rider, <em>LOOK OUT FOR THE HORSE RIDER</em>, and not the ice cream shop next to the junction. It won&#8217;t get you any marks, honest. It&#8217;s much more interesting though.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3012329592241943967-1356805508332615360?l=clairepoof.blogspot.com" alt=""/></div>]]></content>

    <content><![CDATA[<p><blockquote></blockquote>Hiyaaa.<br/>My first name is Claire, most people generally believe that my last name is Poof.<br/>It isn&#8217;t, but life would be much more interesting if it was.<br/>Apparently blogs are also interesting, so I have decided to start one.<br/>I do rather like writing to be honest.<br/>I also like skittles and swings, believe it or not.<br/>I like the tripling and the sibilant alliteration in the title of my blog. Just goes to show what a year of english language at college does to you.<br/><br/>I should probably start to tell you a little about me.<br/>I have ginger hair.<br/>I&#8217;m seventeen.<br/>I live in the north of England. Apparently I don&#8217;t have much of a northern accent though, according to an Australian policeman.<br/>Next year I will be going to university. This scares me, quite a lot more than I&#8217;d usually admit.<br/>I like literature, quite a lot.<br/>I like fashion, quite a lot.<br/>I like music, quite a lot.<br/>I&#8217;m too shy and too nice for my own good most of the time. If I wasn&#8217;t so shy, maybe things would be a lot more interesting.<br/>I think I&#8217;d like to be young forever, like peter pan or kiefer sutherland in the lost boys before the last ten minutes of the film. But that probably wouldn&#8217;t be interesting for very long.<br/>Speaking of which, I&#8217;m going to shut up now.<br/>Inabit<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3012329592241943967-3310262386242295161?l=clairepoof.blogspot.com" alt=""/></div></p>]]></content>
