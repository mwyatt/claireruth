And I&#8217;m still going to eat fish. So basically I have become the easiest -tarian that one could possibly be, YET this is still inexplicably creating unforeseen issues for people. </p>\n<p>Despite the fact that I&#8217;m essentially pescetarian at university anyway. IT IS THE EASIEST OF ALL OF THE -ARIANISMS<br/><br/>And let us remember that I am not becoming vegan. It is not that difficult. Really, I should be making more of an effort. <br/><br/>My first pescey issue (oh yes, I love puns, I do study English after all) occurred just over a week ago, as I was buying my lunch in Coventry train station. I believe I have previously described the aforementioned place in a rather unfavourable light, so I won&#8217;t bore you with more details. Needless to say, the only shop present at this station is a WH Smiths, with a pretty poor selection of products which is fair enough really, seeing as once I was inside with my bags there wasn&#8217;t any room for anyone else. It is tiny. </p>\n<p>So I should not have been surprised that the only two non-meaty meals on offer were cheese, cheese, and more cheese. With pickle. I do not like pickle. And I do not like soggy cheese. Which were the only options available to me.</p>\n\n<p>Luckily it wasn&#8217;t Lent yet so I had chicken.</p>\n<p>Oops.</p>\n<p>The next pescey issue is the somewhat mocking support I have received. My boyfriend&#8217;s main concern was, &#8220;Will it affect me?". My reply: &#8220;No of course not, I&#8217;m not giving up meat for any ethical reasons, you can eat it and I&#8217;ll even cook it for you" (I know, lucky right?). Alas, his dad is the one doing the cooking, and last weekend he presented us with the choices of vegetable or prawn curry. Neither of which my boyfriend likes. Definitely not my fault. </p>\n<p>To further prove that the above episode was entirely not my fault, on Valentine&#8217;s Day we made pizzata together (YES THIS IS A REAL THING) and I allowed him to put pepperoni on his slice after we had served it.  It didn&#8217;t touch my meal, so all is well. </p>\n<p>My mum has also been in a tizz as to what to cook for me. I am not eating meat. I am eating everything else. Indeed, I am even eating seafood. I am essentially cheating. I am a bad person. <br/>Mind you, I couldn&#8217;t think of any ideas as to what she could cook for me when she asked. Oops. Also not my fault&#8230; maybe. </p>\n<p>My boyfriend also likes to call me pesky&#8230; pescey&#8230; Everyone loves this pun. I even love this pun, although it is at my expense.</p>\n<p>I have come to appreciate the trials and tribulations full on, committed vegetarians have to face every single day. I don&#8217;t think I will miss meat, but I do think that I will miss the lack of judgement that I for some strange reason must now put up with, and the vast array of options that I seem to be purposefully avoiding as I skim past the meat section in shops, restaurants and supermarkets, thus making my lack of choice ALL MY FAULT. Well done vegetarians, you are certainly better than me, and you&#8217;re probably better than everyone else too. WH Smith has taught me this. </p>\n<p>I may just not eat meat ever again.

But we&#8217;ll see. Even if I do have to go to school, this really will be my last day.</p>\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t surprise me that I have no real feelings about this. Throughout this assistantship I have felt almost indifferent towards teaching, a sentiment which I didn&#8217;t expect prior to my year abroad. I thought I might love it, and that would be future career sorted. I would take hatred over indifference, at least I would be able to rule out one possibility for the future. Instead I still have no idea what I want. </p>\n<p>I have finally finished <em>Education sentimentale </em>by Flaubert. Not a lot really happens to be honest, but the language was impressive all the same. After having read this incredibly long lesser-known-than-good-old-<em>Madame-Bovary</em> <em>oeuvre</em>, I have turned my attentions to <em>Justine</em> by Marquis de Sade. I have no idea why, I honestly cannot justify this except for the fact that it was a free e-book and I was trying to fill my Kindle with French literature. I maybe should have done some research first. </p>\n<p>The thing is, I don&#8217;t usually have any aversions when it comes to literature. I am fairly good at distancing myself from books, it&#8217;s films where I have more trouble because I can&#8217;t control the image in front of me with the latter format. I am the person who read <em>American Psycho</em> unflinchingly on the bus to college and just before my English Language A Level exam (something which required very little revision, evidently). I will never watch the film, although I am told that the book is actually more explicit, something which shouldn&#8217;t really surprise me when I recall some of the plot details. I am also the person who cites Chuck Palahnuik among her favourite authors. I&#8217;ve read all of his books and the only time I came close to feeling the nausea I have been experiencing whilst reading <em>Justine</em> is maybe during the short story <em>Guts</em> (in the <em>Haunted</em> collection of short stories), and to be fair at least I didn&#8217;t faint like many people did when Palahnuik took his stories on the road and read them aloud to the delight (and horror, admittedly) of many. </p>\n<p>So why is the book so gut-wrenching? I am approximately 20% of the way through (as my Kindle informs me, one useful property which still doesn&#8217;t entirely convince me that this device is in any way superior to books in lovely printed format) and part of me is tempted to give up. I have only ever truly given up on reading two books in my whole life (I eventually returned to <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> though it took some courage&#8230;). The first was <em>It</em>, just because I was genuinely petrified. I&#8217;ve never liked clowns. The second was <em>Angels and Demons</em>, and I think there is no need to justify myself here, it&#8217;s fairly obvious why everyone should give up on this book. I don&#8217;t want to give up on <em>Justine</em>, partly because of my pride (also known as stubbornness) and partly because of the fact that I&#8217;m reading French which can&#8217;t do me any harm, linguistically that is. I think the worst part of this book is the fact that now a routine has been established, and that I know that whenever the <em>pauvre</em> Justine encounters a man (or several, for that matter) I should anticipate what will follow, and this feeling of dread in picturing what will happen to her next (because everything can and will happen) is actually worse than the graphic details. You would think that the same would go for <em>American Psycho</em>, but actually the &#8216;reality&#8217; always exceeded the gory horrors conjured by my imagination. </p>\n<p>I think I need to go back to reading Murakami or something that will cheer my soul and not make me feel physically sick&#8230;</p>', 'post', 1335710309, 'visible', 1),

I&#8217;m not quite sure yet how exactly I&#8217;m going to use this statistic, but it did make me wonder: how important do other nationalities consider their language in the construction of their national identity? </p>\n<p>Or is this just a really, really stupid question?</p>', 'post', 1334759940, 'visible', 1),

Although pre-summer in Bordeaux is practically summer. I passed KFC, a delightful restaurant around the corner from where I live. Two men were sat outside, enjoying fried chicken in the sunshine. One of them felt the need to attempt to grab my arm as I walked past; something was said to me but I was too shaken and downright furious to understand the creepy words (in French, of course) coming from this ridiculous human being.

In French.</p>\n<p><em>"Qu&#8217;est-ce que vous faites?</em> (I think the <em>&#8216;vous&#8217;</em> was rather polite on my part to be honest)&#8230; followed by <em>"DEGOUTANT"</em> in a very loud, infuriated French voice which exploded from little old me as I power walked angrily away from KFC.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure what the man in question&#8217;s response was but I hope sincerely that he was genuinely terrified.</p>\n<p>From now on I resolve to do more than just shoot disgusted looks at these creepy men who think they have the right to comment as they pass me by. On that same walk on Sunday I passed several other creepy men who felt the need to make some sort of creepy comment towards me. I&#8217;m not going to stand for this any more, whether I am in France or <em>chez moi</em>. I must reiterate that it isn&#8217;t just a male French thing to do these creepy things, but these occurrences have taken place a lot more here than they have at home. I&#8217;m not saying that I&#8217;m going to let these creeps provoke me, because I am almost certain that this is the aim of their comments apart from obviously trying to entice me (who are they kidding???), but I am certainly going to make it perfectly clear to them that what they are doing is not normal and it is not acceptable.

Equally please note that I&#8217;m not sure how successful the following methods are, as I meet with varied levels of success on a day-to-day basis. The thing that terrifies me is that I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ll ever be fluent in French, because how can you quantify communication or the use of a language? But I&#8217;ll try not to let that worry me too much. For now, I shall continue to do the following:</p>\n\n<p>1. Change Facebook to French.</p>\n<p>2. Same goes for Skype.</p>\n<p>3. Purchase a French cookbook, struggle laboriously to understand the list of ingredients and then equally to find them in the ridiculously huge supermarket, thus forcing you to give up and just make a stir fry instead, because it sort of looks like the picture of the meal anyway. Sort of.</p>\n<p>4. Pass a French person on the street/in the school corridor/where you live/anywhere in particular and in engage in the French equivalent of what is known in the North as &#8216;Y&#8217;alreyt? Y&#8217;alreyt?&#8217;. Known on this side of the channel as <em>&#8216;Ca va? Oui ca va et toi? Oui ca vaaaa&#8217;</em>. So easy yet it makes you feel like a boss if you do it in public. Or at least it sort of makes you look French, which is the ultimate goal of course. Ensure that you do the exchange in a French, nonchalant manner. </p>\n<p>5. Pretend to be French to a French person on a plane. Or anywhere, for that matter. I somehow managed to pull this off recently despite the fact that my French neighbour heard me speaking English in an impeccable Northern accent to the air hostess, as when he asked me in English if his friend could go to the bathroom I replied <em>&#8216;ouiii bien sur!&#8217;</em> thus leading him for some reason to assume that I was French, and not in fact a clearly English girl just pretending. Badly.</p>\n<p>6. Add or be added by a French person on Facebook/Skype/any other thing in this genre. Even if you never talk to them, it seems pretty impressive to have befriended them all the same.</p>\n<p>7. Add <em>&#8216;quoi&#8217;</em> on the end of every single sentence you speak.

Although I wasn&#8217;t completely and horrifically wrong, it does seem that most of the people I&#8217;ve conversed with tend to use <em>&#8216;du coup&#8217;</em>, which is apparently too informal to use in essays but still useful enough to be chucked around as often as <em>&#8216;quoi&#8217;</em>. </p>\n<p>9. Though technically speaking this one won&#8217;t qualify as pretending to being actually French, as for me it often involves letting the cat out of the bag that I am in fact English and spending my year abroad <em>en France</em>, it is very important to talk to everyone, even people you would usually flee from or at least avert eye contact. I mean, obviously avoid dangerous people, but as for Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses (always friendly, even more so when you accidentally tell them in French that you&#8217;re one too), salespeople, shop assistants, random strangers who don&#8217;t have a creepy glint in their eyes, and so on and so forth. </p>\n<p>10. Finally, do not write about or discuss ways of pretending to be French. Sort of gives the game away. Oops. <em>Peu importe</em>, I am English after all, and I can at least be content with the fact that my French and indeed my confidence appears to improved quite a bit this year.

Apart from the language, slightly better weather (she writes as it is currently snowing in Bordeaux&#8230;) and the fact that I am just not at home, France doesn&#8217;t seem to me to be all that foreign a country.</p>\n<p>We were warned at university that we would all experience a bit of a culture shock during our year abroad. The only things that I have noticed thus far, however, are the following:</p>\n<p>1. The incessantly creepy men. Who become even creepier when they hear you speaking English, &#8216;hello ladiiiiiies&#8217; and whatnot.</p>\n<p>2. The fact that, no matter how I hard I try (n&#8217;importe quoi, you might even say), it is absolutely impossible for me to escape the harsh reality that I am incredibly English, obviously so. Sometimes I can get away with it by putting on a ridiculously overblown French accent but then once a French person looks at me and sees the very clearly English outfit that I am wearing it sort of gives the game away.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t really understand what it is about me that is so typically English. It&#8217;s something that I wasn&#8217;t even aware of before I came to France. Apparently, according to one student at my school, it&#8217;s my ginger hair, but I HAVE seen French ginger people, definitely, because I got very excited and enthusiastic when I did. Or, as a teacher who organises the school newspaper remarked as we looked at a photograph of myself that she had just taken, maybe it&#8217;s the constant flower in my hair that I have become well known for in both my schools and in the foyer where I live. I&#8217;m not sure if many people at all, English or French, wear flowers in their hair on a daily basis to the extent that one&#8217;s hair feels literally naked without a corsage. I can&#8217;t remember when I even started to wear flowers in my hair but now I have a very large collection. Maybe this makes me very English, I honestly do not know.</p>\n<p>I can&#8217;t really pinpoint the epicentre of my Englishness. But it has got to the point where whenever I meet a new French person or I am excusing a cultural faux pas or something of the like, I use <em>&#8216;je suis tellement anglaise&#8217;</em> as a sort of excuse or even apology. I never really thought I would feel sorry about my nationality, it&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m patriotic, not in the slightest, but I think it would be nice if I was mistaken for being French more often than people realising that I am in fact, very, very English. </p>', 'post', 1328441847, 'visible', 1),

Thank goodness for Skype is all I&#8217;ll say.</p>\n<p>The first couple of weeks back in Bordeaux were unfortunately not <em>fantastique</em>. It was hard to settle back into things especially as I had enjoyed being home so much. And especially because I found myself with fewer companions here than I had had before, <em>tant pis</em>. Luckily I do have some <em>super</em> friends here, without whom I would, I think it&#8217;s safe to say, be <em>perdue</em>. </p>\n<p>School is much the same as before.

Google also has decided to remind me on a daily basis that I am in France now (not that I really need a reminder thanks, c&#8217;est tellement évident&#8230;) and Amazon, Play and, alas, even Topshop feel the need to redirect me immediately to their French sites before I get the chance to browse for <strike>Christmas presents</strike> something new and shiny to cheer me up. </p>\n<p>Not that there is any particular reason why I should complain about this. I can understand French and unlike David Cameron I don&#8217;t have a bizarre aversion to the Euro (mind you, I clearly don&#8217;t have a clue when it comes to the economy.

Nonetheless, it is a little bit disturbing.</p>\n<p>Though in all honesty tumblr reverted back to anglais as soon as I logged in with my very much anglais username and password. Hurrah. I think.</p>\n<p>This is the main dilemma of my year abroad so far, and frankly if this is the main problem, I think I&#8217;m doing pretty well. Sometimes, it is just too difficult to find oneself in a situation where <em>il faut parler fran</em><em>çais</em>, and then when one does find oneself in such a situation, sometimes it is a bit of a relief when that situation ends and one reverts back to the old comforts of one&#8217;s mother tongue. For instance, most of the English teachers at my school have now decided that I am well and truly settled in Bordeaux (c&#8217;est vrai) and consequently only French must be spoken, all for my benefit of course. This is supremely helpful, except sometimes it is quite difficult to express myself in French and if a teacher can see my frustration whilst trying to find a certain word they will quickly jump to English to help me out. Which truthfully does not help me out in the slightest. I need to have these language struggles if I&#8217;m going to improve, because not being able to find a word in French (a common occurrence) pushes me to find a different word which will do the same job, whereas allowing me to say the word in English is a bit of a cop-out. At the time I might be grateful for said cop-out but in very wise hindsight the whole point of my year abroad is to improve my language. </p>\n<p>Further difficulties present themselves due to the fact that I have befriended many English speakers in Bordeaux, fellow assistants and friends from university alike. And none of us have the confidence to speak to each other in the language which we are here to practise. Which is a real shame but at the same time sometimes it&#8217;s nice to have a break or some moral support when confronted by French in a shop, café or restaurant. Nevertheless, yesterday Anishka, Zoe and I felt brave and we played Taboo in French, a game which is no doubt difficult in English nevermind a different language. But it is so useful once you force yourself to use the language that you are trying to learn. I am so worried that I am not improving but I think I must have improved at least a little just by being here in France - maybe that isn&#8217;t enough but the whole experience of my year abroad probably will be.</p>\n<p>I will have plenty of time to speak English whilst I am home this time next week.

This is the result of several factors:</p>\n<ol><li>Lack of time. In between lesson planning (ha), essay writing (double ha, even haha) and generally enjoying Bordeaux whilst trying to increase my fluency in French, blogging about everything isn&#8217;t exactly high on my to-do-list. Though in all honesty I don&#8217;t really have a list of things that I need to do, and I have planned lessons for the weeks to come and I have written my essay&#8230; so truthfully, I&#8217;ve just been trying to make the most of my French experience.</li>\n<li>Blogging doesn&#8217;t really figure high in my priorities. I am well aware of the fact that not many people will read this. That doesn&#8217;t bother me. In fact, I prefer to write in my journal which only I will ever read (as long as I guard it carefully of course) and consequently there is little motivation to blog as well.</li>\n<li>By the time I actually have time and motivation to blog, so much has happened that it&#8217;s impossible to recount it all. So I either vaguely summarise things or I just don&#8217;t bother. For the past few weeks/months/whatever, it has been the case of the latter. </li>\n</ol><p>So, to summarise, Bordeaux is great. I have settled in much more than before, my only worry is that my French isn&#8217;t improving vastly. And the time is slipping away. And last weekend was too short.

(26, 'cinquante-et-un: les vacances.', '<p>So after barely three weeks of actual teaching, I am on holiday from school. </p>\n<p>Yes, that&#8217;s right, in France they like to do things a little differently when it comes to education. They have crazy long school days here - I mean whoever decided that it was a good idea to start at 8am and finish at 5pm should be force-fed Camembert or some other smelly cheese, though in reality I suppose the person who decided this would actually probably like that, unlike myself. But in order to compensate for this, the French have long school holidays and more of them. So here I am, and I can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;m actually going to say that this Vacances de Toussaints (All Saints to any non-Frenchies) is going really, really fast.</p>\n<p>I had so much planned for this week and a half. And some of it has been achieved. Sort of. Here were my original plans for les vacances:</p>\n<ol><li>Plan lessons for when I go back to school. A geeky one I know, but I have planned some lessons and it does make me feel slightly less nervous about the return to classes. What does make me feel nervous, however, is the fact that most of the teachers still do not seem to mind what I do with their students. This should make me feel free and whatnot, but this is me after all, so inevitably it makes me fear the worst i.e. failure. Not to worry, I have lessons planned about school uniforms, the Simpsons, the IT Crowd, Coldplay and the classic To Sir With Love to make it interesting - if not for my pupils then at least for me.</li>\n<li>Start thinking about my first essay for university. Another geeky one. Turns out I don&#8217;t really need to worry about this too much, but I have been fairly successful in getting articles together and sort of coming up with my essay title. It&#8217;s about the environment, always easy to come up with arguments for that of course.</li>\n<li>See more of Bordeaux. The rain has made this one pretty difficult. At the moment Bordeaux is doing a very good impression of English weather. If I had a euro for every time I say &#8220;C&#8217;est comme l&#8217;Angleterre maintenant!" Though really it&#8217;s nowhere near as cold obviously.</li>\n<li>Shop. I&#8217;ve done quite a bit of this. Though none of it has been very useful or successful. I have bought one Christmas present, an umbrella (mine broke the first day I used it trying to cross the suddenly very windy Pont de Pierre)&#8230; and that&#8217;s about it. The problem about going shopping here is that it is easy to waste a lot of time looking without getting anything done, resulting in doing the same thing again and again, everyday, and again&#8230; I&#8217;m probably going to go shopping tomorrow.</li>\n<li>Travel. It&#8217;s very expensive to travel in France. And to get to Manchester from the south of France for that matter. Hence the lack of travelling, which I hope to rectify as soon as possible. </li>\n</ol><p>And that&#8217;s about it. The plans have been semi-successful, but despite this I&#8217;ve had a good vacances so far. I&#8217;ve been on the big wheel at the fair and saw Bordeaux from up above, I&#8217;ve been to an Irish bar and sang karaoke and drank wine, I visited an English teacher&#8217;s house and had a real French meal (foie gras, aperitifs, macaroons and all) and I&#8217;ve got together my Halloween outfit, in which my obsession with Hello Kitty will reach its inevitable conclusion.</p>\n<p>I do love Bordeaux.

In fact, on Monday I was supposed to have four hours of lessons. But all my lessons were cancelled or the students simply didn&#8217;t show up. Except for two girls who turned up for a class I have where I should have four students, so I left school on Monday slightly content with the fact that I had taught two students that I like reading books and yes, most English people aren&#8217;t bothered about learning another language BECAUSE HONESTLY WHAT IS THE POINT.</p>\n<p>Successful, yes.</p>\n<p>But today was much more rewarding. Although I had to wake up at six to get to school for eight (because for some strange reason French schools feel that it is necessary to have an 8-5 school day, I still do not understand this) this meant that my fear of having to teach or worse having no one to teach was suppressed by my need to suppress my sleepiness. I also only have one hour of teaching time on Wednesday (8-9, yes I know) but although the English teachers at my school feel bad that I have to wake up so early just for one hour I don&#8217;t actually mind it, I would rather have just the one hour early on in the day rather than at the end of the day. And plus I only have twelve hours of teaching time altogether so really I would be forever known as the awkward and annoying English assistant from the north but without a real northern accent (apparently) if I dared to complain. So I don&#8217;t, and I don&#8217;t need to. </p>\n<p>So my hour of teaching today. The topic was CCTV cameras, and I was with a group of 16-17 year olds who are quite good at English (they&#8217;re in the equivalent of the English Gifted and Talented scheme, or something like that). They were very very quiet at first. My questions such as &#8216;So what have you been learning about CCTV cameras?&#8217; elicited very little response apart from blank stares. Except for one girl with an inexplicable American accent who put her hand up sheepishly every time I asked a question.</p>\n<p>BUT by the end of the lesson somehow there was a full on debate about CCTV cameras raging in the classroom, and one girl even asked me if I felt &#8216;oppressed&#8217; because apparently there&#8217;s over 4 million CCTV cameras in the UK. Honestly I&#8217;ve barely even noticed them. Which doesn&#8217;t figure well with the argument they have learnt that CCTV takes away the liberty of the people. I never even see these cameras or know that they are there. Although today was a good opportunity to mention the riots we had over the summer, I knew they would make good teaching material. </p>\n<p>Aside from teaching, Bordeaux is still an amazing city. But yes, I&#8217;m still homesick and missing my man. I don&#8217;t think that will ever change. Yet I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll ever get an opportunity like this again. I need to enjoy it, and I am doing. Despite everything being crazy expensive here. Despite it being near impossible to get a direct flight from Bordeaux to anywhere in the north of England (damn you London, why do I live nowhere near you?). Despite those horrible moments I get every now and then of doubt then fear then desire to run away home as soon as possible. It&#8217;s still really good here, and teaching is not too shabby either. I&#8217;ll never get to work twelve hours again&#8230; which is a depressing thought. To counteract this negativity here&#8217;s a final thought: I wouldn&#8217;t want to be anywhere else in France.</p>', 'post', 1318419238, 'visible', 1),

And so let my year abroad (technically around seven months) commence.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve always struggled with the term &#8216;have the time of your life&#8217;. I was supposed to experience this term when I began university. But I didn&#8217;t. I mean, I enjoy university, and it&#8217;s a good experience and it&#8217;s worthwhile and everything, but certain things get in the way which I never expected when I originally applied. For example, homesickness. Furthermore, when I applied for university I was <em>sans Martin</em> so I did not foresee struggling to cope with the sadness of maintaining a long distance relationship. However, I managed, and after two years at the University of Warwick, I couldn&#8217;t exactly say that I&#8217;d had the time of my life (it sounds like I&#8217;m quoting Dirty Dancing now, great) but I could say that I had enjoyed it and could certainly do another year of it. I&#8217;d made friends and been pretty successful too.</p>\n<p>However, now another brand new situation has presented itself. It too is another experience where one would say that I should &#8216;have the time of my life&#8217;, but instead now I should owe it all to Bordeaux. I&#8217;ve decided to take this cliché to the full Dirty Dancing level; I might as well, consider it a homage to Patrick Swazye.  The past summer I have denied to myself and to others (without their realising it of course) that I would actually end up coming to France to live here for seven months. But finally Saturday arrived, and I had to fly away by myself. </p>\n<p>It was horrific.</p>\n<p>I knew it would be tough, but I can&#8217;t even begin to explain how I felt, or even how I&#8217;m still feeling a little bit. I&#8217;m struggling to eat and sleep, but surprisingly enough the whole doing everything in French aspect isn&#8217;t quite as scary as I had feared. Everything else, on the other hand, is very overwhelming. I have to get a French bank account, a French mobile, and I don&#8217;t have internet in my room - which has resulted in me resorting to using Skype in the communal Internet Room, where I constantly make a fool of myself by laughing at my boyfriend as he mimics the custom of greeting everyone once you enter or leave a room. Bonjour indeed. To continue my petit rant, the supermarkets are expensive and I have no idea what I want to cook, especially as I don&#8217;t feel like eating at the moment. When I go to a supermarket, I get flashbacks of my first week at university when I went into Tesco, panicked, bought a pizza and left nearly in tears. The French supermarkets haven&#8217;t quite reduced me to tears, but then again even I have enough self control to not cry in public places. Most of the time. </p>\n<p>It sounds like I&#8217;m having a terrible time, which is not the impression I wish to give. Because no matter how hard it gets, it will get better and I will do this. I need to do this. I want to do this. I know that once I settle down a bit, things will get easier and before I know it this year will be over. I need to make it count. And in all fairness, I am incredibly lucky to be here in the centre of Bordeaux. It&#8217;s a beautiful city (I will post photos soon, I keep forgetting to take my camera with me when I go out) and it&#8217;s not too big or threatening, like Paris or London for example. Basically, it&#8217;s an amazing place, and it&#8217;s frustrating that I can&#8217;t fully appreciate it at the moment. I am way too sensitive sometimes, and I just need to get tougher. </p>\n<p>Besides, everyone here in Bordeaux is absolutely lovely. I am staying at a foyer in the centre, which is a place for young people to live who are studying or working and can&#8217;t afford a flat. The staff have had language assistants stay with them before and they are very helpful. The teachers at my school are really kind as well - even the headmistress told me to talk to her whenever I felt sad! The headmistress also has a pug dog which sniffed my feet when I went into her office, c&#8217;est bizarre. I have also been told that I look very English. I don&#8217;t know how I have managed this or whether it&#8217;s a compliment or an insult. So much for trying to blend in whilst I&#8217;m here. </p>\n<p>I want to end this on a positive note. Frankly, I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ll have the time of my life here in Bordeaux, but right now I&#8217;m not in the right frame of mind to judge. I don&#8217;t see why I can&#8217;t though; I just need to settle down and worry less. I should adopt this mantra in general I reckon. </p>', 'post', 1317222718, 'visible', 1),

Once you try to teach them French and they enjoy it and they take a liking to you children can be incredibly sweet; something which I had never considered before. I&#8217;ve never been all that good at dealing with children but this week (so far anyway) it&#8217;s been going so well. To the extent that a few girls gave me hugs as they left the classroom this afternoon at the end of the school day. I suddenly thought that maybe children aren&#8217;t so bad after all.</p>\n\n<p>Yesterday I visited every class in the primary school which my man&#8217;s mum works at (which is the reason as to why I have managed to acquire this work experience in the first place), and I was amazed by how lovely these children all are. I can barely remember being at primary school myself (it scares me to think how long ago it was) but I can sort of recall how difficult yet how fun it felt at the time. I think that&#8217;s how these children find it; everything seems to excite them but it&#8217;s clear that they find things tough sometimes too.</p>\n\n<p>They have no idea.</p>\n\n<p>The rest of the day I planned my sessions for the week for teaching the children French. Today I taught year 3 about the weather in French, and I used this song which is insanely catchy/infuriating and which I have heard about 235899530903236 times today alone. The children loved it though which is the main thing. They really seem to enjoy being able to learn another language which amazes me so much and equally impresses me too. It&#8217;s a shame that they don&#8217;t have the chance to do more French, and I have so enjoyed teaching them. I hope the rest of the week will be just as productive and enjoyable.</p>\n\n<p>It has really boosted my confidence too, this whole experience. I&#8217;ve done session plans which the teachers and even headmistress were impressed with, I&#8217;ve had children today desperate not to leave my table francaise because they&#8217;ve enjoyed the French activities so much, and I&#8217;ve had both teachers and children lamenting the fact that they only have this week to use me to further their understanding of French. It&#8217;s great to feel useful and successful but it&#8217;s just as great to feel that children actually do enjoy learning languages - something which I think is so important to encourage, especially from an early age. That&#8217;s partly why I&#8217;m considering teaching French after university.</p>\n\n<p>Either way, on a more cynical note, this week will be extremely beneficial for my CV in the future.

I rushed my laptop to the engineer at university, and after two and a half painstaking hours I returned to find my files had all been saved, but my laptop had been savaged and left unrecognisable.</p>\n<p>I have now backed up all my files.

You&#8217;re an idiot.&#8217; (or words to that effect, seems plausible to me) and then Aidan buys her a brand new shiny MacBook which she hates because it isn&#8217;t <em>her</em> laptop, it&#8217;s just a replacement for something she can&#8217;t fully replace (though to be fair, she should appreciate it instead of going into crazy-Carrie mode, does she realize how much one of those things cost?).</p>\n<p>Yes, I now empathise with this annoying fictional character (although as much as I call her annoying, I still watch the darn program constantly, hypocritical I know), because even though now all of my precious files have been saved and backed up onto discs - though I don&#8217;t trust them, my laptop or myself anymore - my laptop just isn&#8217;t right. There&#8217;s not much to it, and there&#8217;s not much I can do with it either, seeing as the virus has brutally exposed it&#8217;s weaknesses i.e. slowness, lack of memory, general usefulness, etc, etc, etc. I don&#8217;t really know what to do with it, in all honesty. I don&#8217;t think I have the CD anywhere that would allow me to do a factory reset, and although the university can do this for me for thirty British pounds, I&#8217;m not sure that such a drastic method would improve my laptop in the slightest or make me feel comfortable with it once more.</p>\n<p>It aggravates me that technology gets under my skin like this, and that I&#8217;ve come to rely so much on this piece of equipment.

Modernist Cultures is the wonderful typically English literary title for this wonderful typically English literary module. I remember last year so well, the time when we had to choose our modules and I was so excited by the prospect of studying Woolf, Lawrence, Rhys, Forster and the like. I was even more excited by the possibility that twelve months later I would be able to boast proudly of the fact that not only had I read and studied Ulysses, that gorgeous masterpiece of 900 pages or so of interior monologues and parody and pastiche, but I actually <em>understood</em> it.</p>\n<p>This is why I have come to learn that having great expectations is merely a set up for future disappointments. Mind you, reading about Pip should have taught me that already.</p>\n<p>Consequently at the moment I cannot remember for the life in me why I ever thought this module would be such a good idea. I have enjoyed it, absolutely, I can&#8217;t fault <em>Jacob&#8217;s Room</em> or <em>Howards End</em>, and whereas I may have some issues undoubtedly concerning <em>Women in Love </em>and it&#8217;s ridiculously atrocious characters who make me lose all faith in humanity and make me physically nauseous, in revising the novel I am genuinely, finally starting to recognise its appeal with a brain-revolving epiphany that surely Lawrence would be pleased about. Even Ulysses, with its undeniable chaos and confusion, has made more sense than I could have ever imagined when I first began reading it last summer in an attempt to get ahead for this year.</p>\n<p><em>Alors, quel est le problème?</em></p>\n<p>The fact is, I have an exam on Tuesday about all of these things.

All I can think is, I have an exam on the most crucial modernist texts the world has known and I&#8217;m not sure that I know enough about them.

Leopold Bloom writes I AM A on the beach in <em>Ulysses</em>, and leaves the sentence unfinished (or so it seems); I too feel that I cannot quite fully express my utter and complete dread at the moment. I can only hope that once this exam is over, the rest will follow accordingly, and so it will all be over, for now.</p>\n<p>And besides, my inability to communicate is one of the biggest modernist fears concerning the inadequacy of language.

There&#8217;s probably a job title for that sort of thing but I&#8217;m not fully aware of it.</p>\n<p>However, I have definitely transformed into some sort of a table tennis groupie. I would prefer the title of cheerleader but I think my mum threw away my pom-poms some time ago.</p>\n<p>Anyway, <a href="http://mawyatt.com">Martin</a> was playing in the Blackpool Open this weekend, and he decided bravely to participate in both days whereas previously, whenever I&#8217;ve been to support him anyway, he&#8217;s usually only taken part in the first day. Getting up at 6am on a Saturday and on a Sunday is not my usual idea of fun, but I&#8217;m starting to fair enjoy watching table tennis now. Compared to some other sports, it&#8217;s much more exciting, and it&#8217;s pretty quick too which is always a bonus for someone like me who doesn&#8217;t really have much patience for sport.</p>\n<p>He did really well, trying his best as always, and we met some interesting characters along the way.</p>\n<p>For instance.</p>\n<p>Sulky Jackson 5 boy (I&#8217;m not sure exactly which member of the Jackson 5, but he could have passed for any of them I&#8217;m sure). I don&#8217;t think this young man has learnt how to smile yet, and he certainly didn&#8217;t smile when Martin beat him either.</p>\n<p>Retro tracksuit guy, who Martin didn&#8217;t actually play but we admired his 1980&#8217;s garments from afar. Bright pink, purple and luminous green DO NOT mix, but they do not affect your table tennis skills, fact.</p>\n<p>French/student guy, as in he looks like he could be French yet he equally looks like he could be a student, but not a student of French (we presumed that he is probably studying English Literature with Philosophy, he just has that look). Martin actually played against this guy at Doncaster in February (at least I think it was then&#8230;) and we similarly mocked him then as well. To be fair, in between matches there is not much else we can do except for table tennis people watching. To be honest, I think I prefer French guy to Scottish guy, who was so incredibly sarcastic it bordered on sheer confusion. Some people just won&#8217;t let you play Fruit Ninja in peace whilst you&#8217;re trying to pass the time when your boyfriend is umpiring a table tennis match that you&#8217;re not too bothered about. Jeez.</p>\n<p>This was also the weekend of the headbands. Two players wore sweat-headbands (no, I didn&#8217;t even know they existed either) which added to their extreme intensity whilst playing. Terrifying. One had crazy tattoos about their &#8220;beloved" (wish I was joking) whilst the other also works in the administration of the tournament itself, and so when he arrived to play Martin the surprise was astronomical - probably had something to do with the fact that we were also delirious from sleep deprivation. The latter guy also mysteriously knows Martin very well, which is slightly disturbing seeing as hundreds of people enter these tournaments&#8230;</p>\n<p>Most of the players at this tournament were grateful whenever I returned their stray ball so they could continue their game; however some were just plain disrespectful, how dare they. One guy actually managed to give me a dirty look, not once, but twice.</p>\n<p>Ridiculous.</p>\n<p>I seemed to be the only girlfriend in tow at this tournament, which prompted one of Martin&#8217;s opponents to question my sanity. Thankfully, however, I am nothing like the only other girlfriend I spotted, who instead of trying to cheer up her partner after he lost, merely told him bluntly that he was right, he should have won that match. Unnecessary. She also seemed to possess a lot of technical knowledge about the game that I simply do not understand, but surely that&#8217;s not an excuse to belittle someone you&#8217;re supposed to be there to support in the first place?</p>\n<p>Maybe it&#8217;s just me, but I don&#8217;t think that winning is the be-all and end-all of anything. Without sounding trite, I&#8217;m proud of Martin just because he worked so hard this weekend. I don&#8217;t think I would ever be able to be as dedicated to something, aside from reading and writing, as even with those hobbies my passion is dwindling.</p>\n<p>In other news, I feel tremendously ill.

This time next year, however, my time in France should be pretty much over. My theory is that if I really made an effort to blog about my time over there it could be extremely useful and posssibly even interesting for other people to read, if I&#8217;m lucky. <br/><br/>In the meantime?<br/><br/>It&#8217;s the Easter holidays for me at the moment, and it has been for a few weeks now. University has been pretty hectic this year, with 5000 word essays, 2500 word essays, getting trains back and forth, reading, more reading and finding time to escape from the chaos. My essays for the entire academic year are almost finished, then the exams will arrive, but at the end of it all Martin and I will be going to Majorca, which I am incredibly excited about.<br/><br/>Then it will be France time.<br/><br/>I&#8217;m not as scared as I was before.

(64, 'trente-cinq: trop tard.', '<p>I&#8217;ve said it a million times before, but I really cannot keep up with this blog. I just completely forget about it, which is a shame because I had so much free time this summer and I just re-read my last entry about the Doncaster Open, and it made me laugh even if no one else on the interweb is bothered. I just can&#8217;t believe that that happened last summer, which was a hazy dream that sometimes bored me to tears and sometimes elevated me beyond the natural realms of ecstasy. <br/><br/>But I&#8217;m back at Warwick. In Coventry to be more precise.<br/><br/>This year is slightly different. Easier in some ways, harder in others.<br/><br/><strong>Easier</strong>: we&#8217;re in a house. Much more homely, I don&#8217;t feel as alone as I did last year somehow. But then there are occasional times when I&#8217;m sat in my room and it feels just like Claycroft and I feel like I&#8217;m drowning, that awful suffocating feeling that you just can&#8217;t shake off and translating French or reading Flaubert just does not help in the slightest<br/><br/><strong>Harder</strong>: we&#8217;re in a house that isn&#8217;t on campus. Consequently we have to deal with buses. I quite like buses but I don&#8217;t trust Coventry ones. Not only do you have to have the exact change at all times (not a problem with my bus pass but nevertheless) but seeing as they head towards the university they are often majorly packed. Which is wonderful when you&#8217;re in a hurry. Fortunately I am the most prepared young lady of my generation so I am always an hour early for absolutely everything, wow I&#8217;m so cool.<br/><br/><strong>Easier</strong>: I&#8217;m a uni veteran now. I&#8217;ve kind of got used to the heart pangs and the nausea that accompagnies trop de travail. I can cook and I can clean and I can take care of myself. <br/><br/><strong>Harder</strong>: still doesn&#8217;t make missing Martin and the family any easier. I&#8217;m more settled but every now and then I still burn, and then I have to organise next year en France and it scares me more than a little. But I picked this degree; in all honesty I need to do this. It will help me so much. The work at university is also evidently harder, which was to be expected but maybe not to the extent that we&#8217;ve all encountered. Luckily I&#8217;m quite paranoid about studying and I like to get as far ahead as humanly possible with work etc. Makes it a little easier on myself.<br/><br/>I really am going to try and make an effort.

Unfortunately, I&#8217;m a perfectionist.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. And now I&#8217;m free to enjoy my summer, which has so far been filled with reading, days out and spending time with family, friends and Martin. Until Saturday, when we encountered les pongistes.<br/><br/>Table tennis is way cooler than ordinary tennis. For one, you don&#8217;t really get any overly epic matches in table tennis, i.e. boring rallies which carry on for hours, as was seen in Wimbledon this year. I just can&#8217;t cope with that kind of thing. Luckily for me, my boyfriend prefers the version played on tables, which is much more exciting and doesn&#8217;t drag on for an eternity. In fact, watching him play at the Doncaster Open last Saturday was one of the only times in my life that I&#8217;ve actually enjoyed watching a sport. Usually I just don&#8217;t get it<br/><br/>It did incite me to commit murder though.<br/><br/>The object of my homicidal intentions was a highly irritating coach of a kid that <a href="http://www.mawyatt.com/">Martin</a> was playing in one of his groups. This kid wasn&#8217;t exactly overly confident and thus aggravating, but in contrast his coach on the sidelines was, choosing to clap every time his protégé got a point instead of Martin. He clapped insanely loudly. I was furious. In fact, I was so enraged that I decided to retaliate and clap when Martin got a point&#8230; but my clapping was muffled by my hay-fever induced tissue. Oops. It must have worked though because Martin won so NER NER NER NERRRR stupid arrogant coach man. Martin did really well throughout the tournament, especially in beating this guy who had a high rating very easily, and although he did have a &#8220;quick sulk" as he puts it, compared to the majority of tense players present at this competition (a trait which I had never witnessed in table tennis players before, usually calm and gentle souls), he remained positive and relatively stress-free. Compared to that stroppy pre-pubescent teenager he played at one point his disappointment was nothing, thank goodness I never have to be fourteen again is all I&#8217;m saying. Anyways, I&#8217;m proud so there<br/><br/>Et les lecteurs&#8230;<br/><br/>Desperate for a bit of valuable work experience, I recently contacted my local library to see if they could do anything for me, and their solution was to participate in therapeutic reading groups. My response: huhhh? Their response: come to the staff meeting, it might make a bit more sense. So I did. Today.<br/><br/>After this meeting, I was whisked away to Nelson to observe such an example of this innovation. I watched as a small group of elderly people were read a short story and a poem, and the way they engaged with it and conversed about memories gone by was pretty extraordinary. Although I usually feel uncomfortable all of the time, especially with this kind of thing, I felt quite sentimental for some reason during the whole time I was there.

I really didn&#8217;t expect it, but all of a sudden I&#8217;m back where I started, back in Burnley, back to trying to find a job and trying to read as much as I can whilst I have the time. I have no idea how I got here and how I survived, but all I&#8217;m hoping at the moment is that I really have survived, i.e. that I&#8217;ve passed my first year of university. I&#8217;ll get my results on Wednesday afternoon, but as I&#8217;m at home that means I&#8217;m going to have to ring my university and have a very awkward phone call. Mind you, it&#8217;s much better this way rather than being stuck in my lonely room on campus with nothing to do and missing family and friends and Martin too much. Staying there for another two weeks was completely pointless, and besides I can do so much more at home, even though I do still feel slightly useless here currently. And I&#8217;m starting to worry again about my inability to spend a long period in France this summer, unlike quite a few of the people on my course who will be working abroad and speaking French frequently&#8230; there&#8217;s not much I can do about it now but I&#8217;m just anxious that my French is going to be <em>terrible</em> when I return for my second year, something which I&#8217;m trying not to think about right not, even though I&#8217;m not as apprehensive as I was before. I think once I have my results and know where I stand, I will feel so much better.<br/><br/>However, I really am enjoying being back at home. Yesterday Martin and I went to Blackpool, because it&#8217;s been majorly hot here recently, and it felt great to just be able to relax and not worry about exams or revision or laundry or any of the other things which are daily concerns of my university life. Sometimes I worry that I should have been having the time of my life (as everyone seems to put it) at uni, but that cliche can&#8217;t apply to everyone, can it? Surely the fact that I&#8217;m getting a degree in order to have a better life in the future is enough? Though I can&#8217;t deny that towards the end of this academic year, I really started to settle in and actually began enjoying the whole experience&#8230; the fact is that I&#8217;m too sensitive and too much of a worrier and my anxieties often just get in the way of things.

Almost as delightful as my mock exam for this subject, where I had to consider whether paedophiles should be put to death (too easy was my conclusion in case you&#8217;re wondering for some strange reason). They sure do come up with some interesting topics for us to write about, I remember the good old days of A Level where we churned out essays about the environment, which was the most radical subject we ever considered.<br/><br/>It felt so strange when I put my pen down and left that exam hall yesterday. It still hasn&#8217;t sunk in that I&#8217;ve basically finished my first year of university and have somehow survived it all (in the hope that I won&#8217;t have to return early to do resits that is, fingers crossed please) and now I have a long, free summer to enjoy. It sounds really geeky but I&#8217;m looking forward to being able to read for fun again, though in all fairness I am doing an English degree so I&#8217;m allowed to be geeky about books and literature etc<br/><br/>So tomorrow I&#8217;m heading back to Burnley for the summer, I truly can&#8217;t wait.

His site is much better, <a href="http://www.mawyatt.com">see:</a><br/><br/>So I&#8217;m in the middle of exams, well a third of the way through to be exact. For some reason these exams have been much more stressful than any others I&#8217;ve experienced, and although my mum says I say this every year I know its especially true this year because it&#8217;s just so <em>strange</em> doing exams and revising so far away from home. It&#8217;s horrible to say that I feel lonely sometimes, but it&#8217;s true. I am growing up a lot though, at least I hope I am<br/><br/>2 more weeks or so<br/><br/>After my fairly successful Medieval to Renaissance Literature exam this morning (yes I don&#8217;t know why I&#8217;m studying English and French either), I think it&#8217;s safe to say that I&#8217;m getting into the swing of exams now, in fact this morning kind of felt like it was a year ago, when I was in the midst of A Levels and didn&#8217;t really care that after the summer I would have to move out and grow up. My next exam could possibly be horrific, as I&#8217;ve hated the module from the beginning, but I&#8217;ve decided, thanks to the help of my wondrous friends, family and petit ami, that it&#8217;s best to be positive, and most importantly merci mon petit ami for reminding me to breathe. That&#8217;s very important <br/><br/>So maybe I might make more of an effort with this now. It helps to vent after an exam, and even before it (as my bathroom-mate found out in the early hours of this morning as she heard me screaming in frustration due to lack of sleep), and writing like this definitely helps. I also have another aim for this blog, inspired once again by the petit ami, and that is to focus on something with it. I&#8217;ll probably use it to chart my final weeks of year one of university, and then my adventures in the summer, and possibly might get even more adventurous and actually just write and review things. After all, I did once harbour dreams of being a music or fashion journalist, it&#8217;s just that everything has been so scary as of late. This is no excuse, I&#8217;m going to write, if only for my benefit. And although I&#8217;ll look back on this in a couple of weeks and despair and sigh, right now I want to make an effort, with everything. I&#8217;m trying harder with everything more than I ever have in my life.<br/><br/>Okay rant over. I cannot wait until these exams are over and I can enjoy summer again, last summer seems like an age ago. When did everything change?</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3012329592241943967-1738398040680834282?l=clairepoof.blogspot.com" alt=""/></div>', 'post', 1275407040, 'visible', 1),

I said, &#8220;I&#8217;M IN A HOTEL IN LEEDS, LOL". Seemed quite funny at the time. <br/><br/>But I actually was in a hotel in Leeds, funnily enough.<br/><br/>Every year, this guy called Chris who my dad works with invites us over to Ilkley, near Leeds, where he lives, and we have a meal together and usually stay over in a nice hotel. So that&#8217;s what we did, but we stayed at this hotel in Leeds instead of one in Ilkley. The meal was fair nice, and we drank some strong red red wine. It was very strong. The Wi-Fi in the hotel was pretty impressive too. The constant rain wasn&#8217;t. Apparently we&#8217;re not getting a summer now, gutted. I guessed as much. <br/><br/>Anyway, I&#8217;m also waiting for Emily to return, as I owe her money for Foals [eekk! so excited about that].

Foals, then McFly, then my birthday, then my party, then Boosh live, then Kings of Leonnnn and then Christmas and the usual. Good times :]<br/><br/>No work yet though. I&#8217;m starting to give up on Jobsearch, not that it&#8217;s their fault like. I blame the economy. But I&#8217;m disappointed in myself for not being able to find any work at all. I need the money really. <br/><br/>I need to be more confident with my driving. Maybe I should try and be excited about my lessons instead of the opposite.<br/><br/>I&#8217;m reading <em>the Iliad</em>, it&#8217;s pretty good. However, having studied <em>The Odyssey</em> in Classics at college, I keep finding myself mentally cheering for Odysseus whenever he pops up.

Yesterday was like the weekend, i.e. really sunny and reallyy warm, so I sat outside with my book. Which reminds me, I finished that volume of Daphne du Mari er, ending with <em>Frenchman&#8217;s Creek</em> [eughhh] and <em>My Cousin Rachel </em>[pretty good]. Now I&#8217;m reading that parody of Harry Potter, you know, Barry Trotter. It&#8217;s quite funny actually, but completely stupid and ridiculous.

Just guessing. <br/><br/>Today I watched the very first two episodes of SATC. Now that was weird. Carrie kept on talking directly to the camera, which made me feel more than just a little bit uncomfortable. I did my best to just eat my noodles whenever she did that. <br/><br/>My dad just thought I was singing Good Morning Pokemon. BALTIMORE JEEZZ<br/><br/>Anyway, speaking of Hairspray, I&#8217;m developing something for Zac Efron. I blame Aaron. At my cinema, they now have a big cut out of the cast of High School Musical 3 to match the poster that we all posed next to. It&#8217;s pretty impressive, unlike our obsession. But I am fair excited for this film, I&#8217;ve seen the trailer, and so has my dad, and we both think it&#8217;s hilarious. It looks like the funniest yet.

Instead of watching Hannah Montana re-runs, I decided I&#8217;m going to watch Skins series 2 again, and I also found Sugar Rush on TV Choice on Demand, one of the only perks of having Virgin Media. Thanks Mr Branson for taking my Sky One away, by the way. It&#8217;s quite good, but just a little bit uncomfortable.<br/><br/>I reallyy like the new last.fm.

Fair enough I thought, and went back to watching the SATC movie for the second time. <br/><br/>Yesterday the parents and I went to Blackpool.<br/><br/>The weather is getting increasingly nicer, but in Blackpool it was incredibly windy. I had foolishly decided to wear a skirt [though with tights, because it wasn&#8217;t that warm though it was sunny].

The swing there is boss. But it&#8217;s raining, again. The park near Emily&#8217;s house is also really good.

Luckily I was downstairs this time. I picked up the receiver, only to hear a deafening klaxon on the other end.<br/><br/><br/>"Hello, this is The Captain," the pre-recorded false voice said to me. I could hear the sea in the background. Ohh no.<br/><br/><br/>I didn&#8217;t even bother to wait to find out what I&#8217;d won this time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The waves of the ocean I could hear behind &#8220;The Captain&#8220;&#8216;s voice sounded quite threatening actually. It reminded me of the chapter I&#8217;ve just read in Daphne du Marier&#8217;s <em>Rebecca</em>. I saw the plot twist coming, but it was still surprising. The main character, not Rebecca incidentally, reminds me of myself - shy and insecure. Great.<br/><br/><br/>When I heard the knock on my door this afternoon, I was actually upstairs. Behind my front door was a man who is doing some work for my next door neighbour, and he needed to measure some wall at the back of our houses. He kept referring to my neighbour as &#8220;The Shopfitter", which was a bit strange. I didn&#8217;t have a clue what he was talking about the whole time he was here.<br/><br/><br/>I am no good at painting my nails whatsoever.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The weather looked a bit more promising this morning for a full hour, before the sun disappeared completely behind the greedy clouds. Completely unfair. By four o&#8217;clock it&#8217;s raining, again. It&#8217;s supposed to be good in London next week at least, and I did get a high score on the signs and signals theory test quiz. Bonus. Hazard perception is completely pointless, mind.<br/><br/><br/><br/>I love finding new good music. And really old music, just remixed.<br/><p>That photo above is a familar scenario with my best friend, Emilyy. The one who isn&#8217;t covering her face in shame. That would be me. I do that a lot. She smiles a lot. I&#8217;m glad that she&#8217;s possibly one of the only people in the world I can really talk to. Plus, we have Hannah Montana necklaces. Except that she lost hers, perhaps she should be the one covering her face in shame. Ha. She rang me today, my Dizzee Rascal ringtone screaming out at me from nowhere [ohhyes, I am this cool]. Hopefully she, Michael, Aaron and myself will be meeting up on Saturday, which is good yess :] </p><p>This week, I will make more plans. I need to.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3012329592241943967-7074171133356645427?l=clairepoof.blogspot.com" alt=""/></div>', 'post', 1215594060, 'visible', 1),
(97, 'deux: dégouté.', '<p>This afternoon, the phone rang whilst I was upstairs. Que a mad scramble to get to the phone in time. I&#8217;m surprised I&#8217;m not in the emergency room by now, given the number of times I have had to do this over the past few weeks.<br/>I got to the phone, and it was one of those rubbish pre-recorded messages. Apparently I&#8217;ve won a free holiday or something. Bonus.<br/>Gutted, more like. I nearly died trying to get that phone call, and there was no point whatsoever.<br/>Much like today really. Mind you, last night&#8217;s Sex and The City episodes were good, though today&#8217;s Cornish pasty wasn&#8217;t. Gutted once again.<br/><br/>Speaking of being gutted, it looks like there&#8217;s no chance whatsoever of me earning some extra money in time for London next week [eek! excited]. Yesterday, my mum was at this fashion show [don&#8217;t even ask. I was not impressed i.e. I was highly jealous] and her friend knows someone who works at JobSearch, where I applied for some temp. work. Apparently there is absolutely no work going whatsoever. GUTTED. Ahh well, at least I have my boss new camera, that&#8217;s a plus.<br/><br/>Today I went from being inexplicably jealous of someone to having pity for that same person in about three seconds.<br/><br/>At half past five every Tuesday I have my guitar lesson with my teacher Paul. He&#8217;s ace. I started playing bass guitar a while back, but when I realised just how easy that was I decided to start playing acoustic. My acoustic guitar is beautiful, it&#8217;s all white and everything. I&#8217;m not that good at it though, to be honest. Gutted.<br/><br/>I wish I could write and sing songs like Backseat Goodbye. He is magnificent.<br/><br/>At the moment, the C chord is the worst chord in the world. Most of the time when I play it, it comes out all whiney and it hurts my ears. Much worse, however, were the scary ghost videos Paul decided to show me. They look so false but the weird ghosts come out of nowhere, especially after the panpipe music. I think I screamed; ohh dear.<br/><br/>Y&#8217;know, if I can&#8217;t get a job, I should at least find something more productive to do with my time, instead of just reading, watching tv and revising driving theory.<br/><br/>I think I need to get out of the house, but the weather is so disconcerting. It looks like it won&#8217;t pick up for quite some time. Gutted, again.<br/><br/>Finally, note to self: when practising hazard perception for your theory test, if it asks you to look out for the horse rider, <em>LOOK OUT FOR THE HORSE RIDER</em>, and not the ice cream shop next to the junction. It won&#8217;t get you any marks, honest. It&#8217;s much more interesting though.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3012329592241943967-1356805508332615360?l=clairepoof.blogspot.com" alt=""/></div>', 'post', 1215509280, 'visible', 1),
